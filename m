Hi Alex, hi Richard

The discussion looks really interesting. I would like to contribute
some comments from the point of view of a rather naive user and try to
understand the workflows for which these improvements would be
beneficial also on a bigger picture.

We are currently experimenting with replacing the eSDK installer with
the bitbake build environment for our users. Part of this
transformation is, of course, the shared sstate-cache, for which this
discussion seems quite relevant. The workflow we are aiming for is as
follows:

   1. Setup the layers and build config (out of scope here)
   2. Download the sstate for a particular recipe (usually an image
      recipe).
     =20
      Note: Working with SSTATE_MIRRORS does not work very well because
      bitbake connects way too often to the sstate server. So we
      started to develop a script which downloads the sstate artifacts
      into SSTATE_DIR to get the SDK set up.
     =20
      Your point 1. is basically what our (a bit hacky) download script
      does in the --dry-run mode: Printing all the required sstate
      artifacts. I think as a first step, it would be very valuable to
      have a function or a tinfoil API in the core that returns a list
      of sstate artifacts for a given recipe.
     =20
      As a second step a tool or a new feature of an existing tool
      could download the artifacts into SSTATE_DIR. This would also be
      a great successor for the not so much maintained devtool sdk-
      update command.
   3. At this point, the user is basically in the same situation as
      after installing the eSDK installer. devtool and now also bitbake
      are available, the sstate-cache is fully populated.

Maintaining such an SDK and sstate mirror infrastructure brings us to
your point 2. Tooling for maintaining the sstate cache becomes even
more important than it is now. Also, locking the sstate cache and
treating missing artifacts as errors seems to be an important feature.=C2=
=A0

But I would consider the locking/unlocking more relevant for testing
rather than for deploying locked SDKs. Unlocked SDKs allow the user to
switch the branches of the layers to commits where the sstate is not
available. If the user is in a full featured bitbake environment rather
than the constrained eSDK installer environment this is perfectly fine.
Bitbake can just compile the missing recipes.
Such an SDK would combine all the advantages of the current eSDK
installer and the much more flexible Bitbake environment. This would
imply that the sstate download script should just try to download
what's available on the mirror and maybe print a warning for artifacts
which cannot be downloaded. But it should not abort with an error for
missing artifacts.

Does that make sense?

Adrian

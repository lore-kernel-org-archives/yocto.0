:) I see, but the point is that I'm not changing those entries based on
what I'm building. It's "customization" which would normally be included
in distro config based on what distro supports, but in this case I'm
using nodistro and want to build test more than what's "supported" in
nodistro.

Yes, people often need to tweak local.conf, but my point is that they
shouldn't tweak it based on what they are going to build.

e.g. if I decide to build qtbase with icu enabled, then I should use the
same qtbase in core-image-minimal and wayland-image, otherwise I'll see
a lot of rebuilds and not-so-good sstate reuse (especially if you often
use sstate-cache-management which will remove your 2nd qt* variants
between the builds).

We keep seeming to discuss this but it is really quite simple, we
document what we test on.

We are currently testing on alma8 and alma9. I don't know which version
of alma9 but I'd suspect the most recent one and we can check. We can
list those until the workers are retired.

With regard to the failed builds, the question is whether the failed
builds are due to the patches under test or some underlying issue with
those systems. They would not be in general use in the pool if they
weren't able to build master so it is fine to document all of those
there for master. I'm sure the failures are due to failures in patches
under test at this point.

The exclusion list for older releases can be and is different as some
workers are not enabled for some releases. You can see the mappings
here:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-autobuilder2/tree/config.py#n160

i.e. mickledore is matching master so far and kirkstone isn't using
fedora38 yet (for example).

Cheers,

Richard

"group" or "packagegroup" or "package-group" is my suggestion for the existing 
'task' recipes.  From what I've seen, it should be a rename opportunity -- we 
can even provide/rprovide the old names....

During the pre-oe-core Yocto Project development, a design was generated to 
roughly group the packages into functional areas.  For the most part, this 
design (as well as legacy elements) still exist.

I think the boot, base and others need to be evaluated for usefulness... but my 
feeling is most of them are close to being correct.

The original design attempted to group things into functionality, so that OE 
could be an "additive" distribution.  I.e., you don't start with a big blob of 
packages and remove them as necessary, but instead you start with small 
functional blocks and put them together to construct a system.  The tasks seemed 
to be the logical blocks, and the contents of these blocks were based on the 
early design.

Very roughly speaking the early design was:

filesystem
|        \
libc    libstdcxx
|           \
small cli    \
(busybox)     \
|              \
basic commands  python -- perl
|                 |         |
initscripts       |         |
multiuser         |         |
system services --+---------+
|
LSB functionality

(Lines indicate implicit dependencies)

The goal was that if you include a specific group, such as "multiuser" support, 
you would get all of the recipes necessary to enable multiuser support on the 
system.  I think this is a reasonable theory to consider when evaluating the 
existing groupings.

Yup, there is a logical grouping for the lsb specific tasks, as for others.  The 
naming needs to be made clear as to why it's there, and what it represents. 
Same with the summary and descriptions -- they should list the functionality 
provided by this group of components.

I'd certainly prefer that images were limited to selecting software from task 
(group) recipes only, and not providing their own.  An image should be able to 
change the selection based on an "image feature" or similar configuration, but 
the underlying tasks/groups, recipes, etc should all be 'generic' to a given 
distribution configuration.

I think if you go through the images today, a lot of that stuff is either old, 
or could be simplified by creating appropriate tasks/groups.

Our master tends to lag behind oe-core's master for a few reasons, but
none of them are really insurmountable.  Certainly the intent is that
meta-selinux/master will build successfully with oe-core/master at any
given time.

I've been doing SELinux stuff for rather a long time and it's generally
been my experience that there's a set of developers / vendors that
*really* want it and know what they're doing, there's another set that
*really* want nothing to do with it and a group that say they want
SELinux support but then immediately start needing to turn stuff off
because it causes their system to behave too differently.

Taken as a simple maintenance thing, I think it's easier to have SELinux
be part of OE-Core.  Given, though, it's really not possible to divorce
much of SELinux functionality from python on the target, so then I don't
know if it really makes sense for something like that to be part of
oe-core, proper.  I would think no.

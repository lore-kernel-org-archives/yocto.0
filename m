PIE is nowadays more or less the only available option and is expected for
improved security; Yocto does not even test non-PIE builds or provide an
off the shelf way to turn it off.

I also have to note that prelink does show higher RAM consumption in your
tests as well (MemFree column). On the constrained systems which would
benefit most from improved prelink timings that might be a bigger loss than
not prelinking.

But yes, there is a timing benefit visible in the tests: 0.01s vs 0.1s.

Can you please rebuild your test images without PIE mode and re-run the <br=

tests?<br>
<br>
Then we should have the 4 test cases:<br>
<br>
prelinked-with-pie<br>
no-prelink-with-pie<br>
prelink-no-pie<br>
no-prelink-no-pie<br>
<br>
I guess then we can discuss what are the next steps.<br>
<br>
In my opinion the current default settings, which compile close to <br>
everything in PIE mode, but invoke also cross-prelink do not make much <br>
sense.<br>
<br>
The question is: &quot;Do we want to drop cross-prelink, or do we want to <=

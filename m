I like it, though I have a couple of questions about the accounts
themselves.

   - Any chance we could have them connected (or use the same
     credentials as) the patchworks ones?

   - If not, what options can we set on accounts?  Right now I just see
     "log out" and "change password".  Both pretty important, but I'd
     also like to add alternate email addresses, for example, since I
     use two quite regularly and update meta-networking from both.

I'm using linux-ti-staging kernel 3.14.x with Yocto dizzy, for a build for =
BeagleBone Black based system.

I'd like to use initramfs in my kernel. So I've set INITRAMFS_IMAGE in my l=
inux-ti-staging_3.14.bbappend, and INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE =3D "1" in local.=
conf. Now in build dir tmp/deploy/images/<boardname> I'm getting zImage-ini=
tramfs-<boardname>.bin being built fine.

However, I'm not getting an initramfs image being deployed to /boot, but ju=
st a plain zImage without an initramfs.

Looking in the build directory tmp/work/<boardname>-poky-linux-gnueabi/linu=
x-ti-staging/3.14.39-r22b+gitrAUTOINC+ba552b4bc7/packages-split/kernel-imag=
e/boot I see there is:

zImage-3.14.39
zImage-initramfs-<boardname>.bin

--however the zImage-initramfs-<boardname>.bin file isn't being included in=
 deploy-rpms/<boardname>/kernel-image-3.14.39-3.14.39-r22b+gitrAUTOINC+ba55=
2b4bc7.<boardname>.rpm for some reason.

But, if I change my linux-ti-staging_3.14.bbappend to include any one of th=
e following lines, then the kernel-image .rpm file _does_ include both zIma=
ge files:

RDEPENDS_kernel-base =3D ""
RDEPENDS_kernel-base =3D "kernel-devicetree"
RDEPENDS_kernel-base =3D "kernel-image"

But if I put:

RDEPENDS_kernel-base =3D "kernel-image kernel-devicetree"

--then there is no zImage-initramfs-<boardname>.bin in the kernel-image .rp=
m. This seems very confusing.

Why would zImage-initramfs-<boardname>.bin disappear from the kernel-image =
package when the linux-ti-staging RDEPENDS_kernel-base specifies both kerne=
l-image and kernel-devicetree, but not other cases?

I tried, but I stumble on the need to copy the latest switchers.js from
yocto-docs to the Bitbake branches too.

And since the Bitbake branches need to be checked out and processed
first, I hesitate to add a special extra step to checkout the yocto-docs
repo before. Possible but adding complexity.

So, if I don't use this way for the Bitbake branches, I still need a
find command at the end...

If you don't think about any better idea, I'd propose to stick to this
version of the patch.

Cheers
Michael.

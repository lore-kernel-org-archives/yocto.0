It works for me now but it's not clear why. It seems that
it was a problem with my firefox profile.

Work log below in case it might help someone else.

../Randy


I rebooted:
   - still no menu.
I logged out and then into another account on the same laptop:
   - it worked.
I created another firefox profile in my usual account:
   - it worked.
I deleted that profile and used my default profile:
   - still no menu.
While visiting layers.openembedded.org, I opened the firefox
console using Shift+Control+K
   - I re-loaded the site.
   - it worked!
I closed the console:
   - it worked!
I restarted firefox:
   - it still works!

Hmmm, oh well.

Yea, that's the sort of approach I was expecting. Getting musl to
build is the easy bit, making it usable as the system libc for an
entire image is the difficult bit. I think at least initially we'd
need a few bbappends in a meta-musl layer to fix packages which don't
compile out-of-the-box with musl.

I don't think musl fills the nommu gap though - from the comparison
page I linked to it says musl doesn't support mmu-less
microcontrollers.

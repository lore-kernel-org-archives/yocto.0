I wouldn't recommend this in a core recipe, since there may be task
dependencies, or someone, somewhere extending those tasks.

If they aren't triggering the problem you are fixing, I'd leave them as-is.
If they are the root cause, that's a different story.

Cheers,

Bruce

-<br>
-=C2=A0 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
-freedom to share and change it.=C2=A0 By contrast, the GNU General Public=
<br>
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br=
>
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.=C2=A0 This=
<br>
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
-Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit t=
o<br>
-using it.=C2=A0 (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered =
by<br>
-the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)=C2=A0 You can apply it to=
<br>
-your programs, too.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<b=
r>
-price.=C2=A0 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that y=
ou<br>
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br=
>
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<b=
r>
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br=
>
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<b=
r>
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<b=
r>
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
-you have.=C2=A0 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the=
<br>
-source code.=C2=A0 And you must show them these terms so they know their<=
br>
-rights.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,=
 and<br>
-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
-distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make c=
ertain<br>
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
-software.=C2=A0 If the software is modified by someone else and passed on=
, we<br>
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<b=
r>
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<b=
r>
-authors&#39; reputations.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
-patents.=C2=A0 We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<=
br>
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br=
>
-program proprietary.=C2=A0 To prevent this, we have made it clear that an=
y<br>
-patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at al=
l.<br>

-=C2=A0 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
-modification follow.<br>

GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICAT=
ION<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contain=
s<br>
-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
-under the terms of this General Public License.=C2=A0 The &quot;Program&q=
uot;, below,<br>
-refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program=
&quot;<br>
-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
-language.=C2=A0 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation =
in<br>
-the term &quot;modification&quot;.)=C2=A0 Each licensee is addressed as &=
quot;you&quot;.<br>
-<br>
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.=C2=A0 The act of<br>
-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br=
>
-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;=
s<br>
-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br=
>
-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
-along with the Program.<br>
-<br>
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<b=
r>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portio=
n<br>
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent not=
ices<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 stating that you changed the files and the date of any chan=
ge.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, =
that in<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or=
 any<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all=
 third<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 parties under the terms of this License.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interact=
ively<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<=
br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or displ=
ay an<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and =
a<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you =
provide<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program und=
er<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy o=
f this<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 License.=C2=A0 (Exception: if the Program itself is interac=
tive but<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 does not normally print such an announcement, your work bas=
ed on<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
-<br>
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.=C2=A0 If<br>
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.=C2=A0 But when you<b=
r>
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.=
<br>
-<br>
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
-collective works based on the Program.<br>
-<br>
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br=
>
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
-the scope of this License.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,=
<br>
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br=
>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-rea=
dable<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of S=
ections<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software int=
erchange; or,<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least th=
ree<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than y=
our<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 cost of physically performing source distribution, a comple=
te<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to =
be<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a =
medium<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the=
 offer<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 to distribute corresponding source code.=C2=A0 (This altern=
ative is<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you=
<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 received the program in object code or executable form with=
 such<br>
-=C2=A0 =C2=A0 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
-<br>
-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
-making modifications to it.=C2=A0 For an executable work, complete source=
<br>
-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
-control compilation and installation of the executable.=C2=A0 However, as=
 a<br>
-special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
-itself accompanies the executable.<br>
-<br>
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program=
<br>
-except as expressly provided under this License.=C2=A0 Any attempt<br>
-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br=
>
-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
-parties remain in full compliance.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not=
<br>
-signed it.=C2=A0 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or=
<br>
-distribute the Program or its derivative works.=C2=A0 These actions are<b=
r>
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.=C2=A0 Therefore, by<=
br>
-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
-the Program or works based on it.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on th=
e<br>
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br=
>
-these terms and conditions.=C2=A0 You may not impose any further<br>
-restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein=
.<br>
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
-this License.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of paten=
t<br>
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br=
>
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.=C2=A0 If you cannot<br>
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br=
>
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br=
>
-may not distribute the Program at all.=C2=A0 For example, if a patent<br>
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br=
>
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
-<br>
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br=
>
-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
-circumstances.<br>
-<br>
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
-implemented by public license practices.=C2=A0 Many people have made<br>
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br=
>
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
-impose that choice.<br>
-<br>
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
-<br>
-=C2=A0 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<=
br>
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
-countries not thus excluded.=C2=A0 In such case, this License incorporate=
s<br>

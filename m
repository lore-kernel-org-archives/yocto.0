You've fixed util-linux in a different way to me, I added qsort_r to
musl whereas you've removed it's use from util-linux. I'm not bothered
which one we use if both work. We do now have 4 people looking at
util-linux fixes: Me, you and Robert Yang (as util-linux-native
doesn't build on Centos 5.10 due to the same qsort_r usage) here in
oe-core and Karel Zak from upstream (as they want to fix it for their
next release). I think we need to pick one fix (probably yours if it's
tested and working in another distro) and get it applied to oe-core
master.

Your latest commit "glibc-2.0: Fix build issues that arise on musl"
should say glib not glibc. Other than that, your glib fix is better
than mine (I did add <string.h> but didn't add the
'--with-libiconv=gnu' option, instead I set musl as the provider of
virtual/libiconv).

I don't currently have access to -contrib as I haven't previously needed it.

I also think it's pretty low visibility and difficult to comment on
particular patches compared to having a layer with patches being sent
to the yocto@yoctoproject.org list for review.

Do you think all of this will eventually be accepted into oe-core? I
didn't think musl would be while our support for it is fairly
experimental.

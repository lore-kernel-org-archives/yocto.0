Right, what we lack is a way for the user to ask this and see the
result easily. As you say, bitbake can do this already.

I think there is also the scenario of:
"I've run a build and have an existing TMPDIR and stamp info. I've now
pulled in a change. How much is going to rebuild and more importantly
*why*?"

This is different to a remote sstate situation as you have the stamp
info of the previous build already there to compare against.

In theory you can do an:

ls sstate/*/*/sstate:curl:corei7-64-poky-linux:<PV>:<PR>:corei7-64:10:*_pac=
kage.tar.zst

and get a list of possible objects. Some key information was put into
the cache file names for this reason. Obviously this becomes much
trickier when the sstate is remote over http though.

"newest" is problematic in this context as you really want the closest
match. There is no concept of build date in the cache as it often isn't
relevant (building an old release for example). The only point a
date/time is used is for cleaning out the cache for files which haven't
been accessed in a long time.

The tools are already supposed to support doing this with local file
sstate sources, they just do a bad job at getting the diffs right. One
intent of this work item was to try and understand why they don't work
and address that so at least for filesystem sstate mirrors, you can get
better results. I don't know how we solve the remote http issue as yet.

I'm not sure this helps as much as you'd like. For example I build
core-image-sato-sdk on the autobuilder and populate this but you want
to build core-image-sato locally. There would be no info here that
would help with information about what core-image-sato would need,
despite the fact we know one is a derivative of the other and there
would be a near full cache for it.

Taking your example above and curl:do_package, how would the list of
information above tell us why it wasn't and what the configuration
difference was? It can tell us a set of different configs which result
in hashes but not how an unknown hash may differ from the existing
configs. The best you could do is iterate the configs and see which one
got you closest to what you have but I suspect that may be even more
expensive that the sstate search mentioned above, indexing of http
aside.

I can see it helping for some limited debug scenarios but the
information you want is really mostly what is already being encoded
into the sstate filename.

Running with that thought, if that information is what we really need,
should be we indexing it and sharing through some kind of hash
equivalence like service to provide the index?

Effectively those "configs" are what the eSDK is, you're just proposing
a server side set of them rather than a built copy. In many ways that
could be useful way of possibly rethinking the way the eSDK works.

So in that sense I like the idea, we should just be clear the problem
it solves as it doesn't solve the "why is my build not using the cache"
question specifically but it potentially solves other issues.

Cheers,

Richard

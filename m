Just because people have things to push or are pushing things which
aren't bugfixes doesn't mean their time is being taken up by anything
but stabilization right now. Your statement implies that everything
being pushed is being currently worked on, which is incorrect. I'm
sure Mentor isn't the only company with a backlog of already complete
local changes to get upstream..

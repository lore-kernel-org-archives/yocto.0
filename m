Thanks for your reply.

The issue I have is that I have to pass additional variables into 
fetcher. More specifically,
I'm using a git:// protocol proxy tool, which requires GIT_SOCKS_PROXY 
variable.

I have made a bit more changes in this patch, I'm trying to make the 
code'perfect'.
But as you said, we could also add an API for adding additional 
variables into fetcher,
that's safe for back compatibility, but a bit more complicated for 
furture maintainability.
Please tell me which one you prefer.


By the way, I found two recent commits on this issue:
  (commit ID)
348384135272ae7c62a11eeabcc43eddc957811f
5dce2f3da20a14c0eb5229696561b0c5f6fce54c
which means the variables used by fetcher may change frequently.

I think it's a good a feature if we could add custom variables into 
fetcher. For example,
we could fetch private code by adding username or password, or we could 
adding custom
proxy tools.


Thanks,

Mingrui Ren

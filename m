Hi,

Actually I want to access external git server of our client using yocto SRC=
_URI. But I am not able to create path to git server .


I just have following info of external server with me

1)~/.ssh/config file

host xyz
user epuser
hostname ep-code.xyz.com
port 22
identityfile ~/.ssh/abc_r.j


2)abc_r.j.pub file
3)abc_r.j file

I am not able to understand which URI protocols will work for me to set pat=
h in SRC_URI of .bb file


Same thing on linux prompt works like this
$git clone xyz:sysconfig



$buildroot>make git-checkout
Available tag used is xxx-ep-20130823-3.0-alpha
Available server epuser@ep-code.xyz.com:/


Regards,
Rohit Jindal

Many thanks for everything you did for the project, and are still doing 
for the wider embedded Linux community. You will be missed here but I 
hope you will still be around.

Now the bar is high and Josef is expected to stay as an official 
Community Manager for at least 5 years ;-)

Thanks again to you Nico and thanks to Josef for taking over!
Michael.

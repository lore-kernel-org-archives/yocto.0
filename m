Hi Jupiter,
To centralize, agreed that you are using systemd, one way I could see is
setting the variables in systemd-system.conf using the DefaultEnvironment
directive, see:
https://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-system.conf.html

This states:

----
DefaultEnvironment=3D=C2=B6
<https://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-system.conf.html#Defa=
ultEnvironment=3D>

Configures environment variables passed to all executed processes. Takes a
space-separated list of variable assignments. See environ(7)
<http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html> for details about
environment variables.

Simple "%"-specifier expansion is supported, see below for a list of
supported specifiers.

Example:

DefaultEnvironment=3D"VAR1=3Dword1 word2" VAR2=3Dword3 "VAR3=3Dword 5 6"

Sets three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3".
----

This should have you variables management in each. Otherwise as you mention
one can put in each script with either Environment to have them explicitly
enumerated or with EnvironmentFile to read from a file, which may also fit
your centralization hopes (but still require one line per startup script at
least) and could be further sourced by non-systemd components as well if
needed. (https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html
under Environment section)

HTH,
Federico

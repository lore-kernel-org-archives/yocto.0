Sorry I am fairly new to bitbake.  How do I apply a patch?  Why do I have
to apply a patch as opposed to just editing corresponding files (I know
that is probably a dumb question but again I am very new to bitbake)?  Khem
Raj did mention a patch to fix the problem:

https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/linux-yocto/commit/?id=8af11c1cdd8fa08217e702b57cf96e9030db52b2

Would I be able to somehow take the patch from that website and apply it to
my project?  Though I'd like to mention again it seems like that patch is
trying to change  "#!/bin/awk -f" to "#!/usr/bin/awk -f" in the ver_linux
file.  But the ver_linux files in my project look very different from the
ver_linux file in the patch (see example of my ver_linux file:
https://gist.github.com/WayneZhenLi/c7475cf382a80bfd2de31e82c40c1677) and
has "#!/bin/sh" for its #! line instead.  In that case, would the patch
Khem Raj mentioned even work for my project?  Again I'm new to bitbake so I
apologize for my questions being naive.

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0that I found in my project was that the shebang lin=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0instead of &quot;#!/bin/awk -f&quot; which is the s=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0in the patch.=C2=A0 The patch wants to change the s=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0-f&quot; to=C2=A0 &quot;#!/usr/bin/awk -f&quot; so =
I&#39;m not sure how that change would translate<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0when I&#39;m working with the shebang line &quot;#!=
/bin/sh&quot;.=C2=A0 Or perhaps Yocto has<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0changed since that patch was posted and maybe the p=

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0So after further investigation, I&#39=
;m fairly sure awk is actually present<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0in the target image.=C2=A0 Here are m=
y reasons why I feel that this is the case:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0-I looked at the busybox menuconfig G=
UI that comes up when I run<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&quot;bitbake -c menuconfig busybox&q=
uot; and it says awk is built-in.=C2=A0<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0-I looked at various def-config files=
 I found by just doing a &quot;grep -rn<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0&quot;CONFIG_AWK&quot;&quot; and foun=
d that CONFIG_AWK seems to have been enabled<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0throughout the project (there was the=
 line CONFIG_AWK=3Dy uncommented in<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0the various def-config files I mentio=
ned).=C2=A0<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0-I have an older version of the targe=
t image that my coworker (who has<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0since left the company) created.=C2=
=A0 I just need to rebuild this image<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0because I am trying to add some kerne=
l modules to the image.=C2=A0 When I run<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0the command &quot;awk&quot; in the co=
nsole for the T4240 RDB when the older<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0version of the image is loaded, I do =
see the gawk help info come up.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0This shows awk is present in the olde=
r image.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0But looking at what Khem Raj mentione=
d, perhaps bitbake is just not<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0finding the awk because it&#39;s actu=
ally in /usr/bin when bitbake expects<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0it to be in /bin?=C2=A0 Though I am a=
 little confused about the link you<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Or maybe do you guys think maybe the =

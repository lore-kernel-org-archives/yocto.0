On further inspection of the older image my coworker made, it looks like
awk is located at "/usr/bin/awk".  I see this by just doing a "which awk"
in the console of the T4240 RDB when the old image is loaded.  So it looks
like the most likely case is that Khem Raj is correct and that bitbake is
expecting awk to be in "/bin" when awk is actually in "/usr/bin".  In that
case, I need to know where the line telling bitbake to look for awk in the
"/bin" directory is.

&gt; &gt; exist.=C2=A0 Like if<br>
&gt; &gt; I run &quot;/bin/awk&quot; in the console I see help info come up=
 describing<br>
&gt; &gt; how to<br>
&gt; &gt; use a program called &quot;gawk&quot;.=C2=A0 Why can&#39;t bitbak=

&gt; &gt; then?=C2=A0 Or am<br>
&gt; &gt; I misunderstanding what this error is trying to say?=C2=A0 I mean=
 I&#39;m<br>
&gt; &gt; assuming<br>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s just not able to find /bin/awk but maybe the error means=
<br>
&gt; &gt; something<br>
&gt; &gt; else?=C2=A0 Or maybe /bin/awk is actually relative to some path?=
=C2=A0 Let me<br>
&gt; &gt; know<br>
&gt; &gt; your thoughts.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; /bin/awk is missing on your target image that will run on the T4240<br=
>
&gt; RDB.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The smallest implementation is to enable CONFIG_AWK in your busybox<br=
>
&gt; config.<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
import something like below patch into your kernel will help too<br>

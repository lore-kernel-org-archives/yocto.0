I'm kind of surprised when seeing this data, as I thought we have upgraded =
more
than 110 recipes. Then distro team gathered just now to understand whether =
there's
anything mismatch. The major point causing confusion is that the code gener=
ating
above sheet is stateless, which doesn't track historical data while there d=
o have
many packages releasing new versions just in M2 window. This then moves som=
e
packages we do upgrade into the '160' group. Basically we think those items=
 with small=20
version difference fall into this category. So it's not that bad as I origi=
nally thought. :-)

Ke is collecting some data and will reply later to clarify in 160 recieps:
	- what have been upgraded in M2 window already, and
	- what have not been touched at all

With that data we'll see how much work remains in M3 for this task.

On the other hand, along with this I realize that there's one area we need =
further
discuss. How often should we upgrade packages in a given release cycle? Mee=
Go=20
only does once. For Yocto we want to keep our recipes in cutting-edge which=
 is=20
why we schedule two upgrade windows in M2 and M3 this time. The policy for =
each=20
recipe however could be a bit different:

	- M2 is our 1st upgrade window, within which we try to upgrade as many=20
recipes as possible to avoid rush push in last release point. The order is =
done by:
		* first upgrade small version changes in a batch which normally implicate=
s=20
those recipes have been touched in previous release cycle and thus small ri=
sk
		* then upgrade the rest recipes which may need more debug time=20
because they may not been touched for some time or at all

	- M3 (now) is our 2nd upgrade window, within which we try to ensure our=20
final release in cutting-edge. Then I suggest a reverse order:
		* first upgrade recipes which haven't been covered in M2, which implicate=
s=20
more work required and higher risk
		* then upgrade small version changes at end of the window. This way=20
can ensure catching latest version or else we may need to do it multiple ti=
mes if doing
it too early. This has small risk

So in generally I propose to have a longer window for recipes which have be=
en=20
upgraded and got a new version now. For now we can have distro team focusin=
g on
those recipes which haven't been touched yet.

Does it sound OK?

----

BTW, I think our package report system (in experimental phase now) can help
the upgrade decision clearly. A suggested flow will be:

The server checks upstream version every day or every several days. When th=
ere's
a new version newly released, a mail will be sent to the recipe owner and C=
C this
list.

The owner then need react to the notification:
	- verify whether this is a valid message
	- decide whether a upgrade is required. The reason for non-upgrade could b=
e:
		* pure SCM commit (for SCM check we may need more thinking)
		* an unstable release
		* known critical bugs/security holes
		* not worthy of upgrade effort since no new features are introduced
		* ...
	- mark decision on the package report system
		* to-be-upgraded
		* not upgrade (if so, reason). If we still use RECIPE_NO_UPDATE_REASON,
then a patch may be required to update that field
	=09
The package report system will record all the historical versions and decis=
ions, to
avoid trigger unnecessary messages again.

When a upgrade window starts and ends, we can then use above stateful data =
to
draw overall picture and track our progress accurately.

Thanks

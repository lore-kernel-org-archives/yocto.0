Hi,

I have cross compiled NSS 3.13.1 for x86 64 bit environment, but when I try
to add NSS package in rootfs, i am getting the following error,

*error: Failed dependencies:
       /usr/local/bin/perl is needed by nss-3.13.1-r0.x86_64*

I know perl is needed for nss, but the path which is trying to look perl,
is quite confusing me, for perl doesn't exist in that location at all. Can
anyone please tell me whats going on here and what have I missed?

P.S: I am using Yocto-1.1.1 and Ubuntu host-11.10 64 bit.

Thanks all for your help,
JC

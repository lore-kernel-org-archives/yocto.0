Hi All

As you might have noticed gcc 4.9.0 was released today

changed are here http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html

I have updated my contrib tree to use the release tar balls. Please
test the branch out. If you are using OE-Core
standalone you don't need to do anything once you apply the patches
from contrib branch it should select 4.9
I have left 4.8 still there since we want to phase it out only when we
are sure that complete ecosystem is working
fine with 4.9

Thanks
-Khem

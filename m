Hi all,

As a newbie to bitbake and Yocto I have attempted to explore the 
behaviour, characteristics and performance of bitbake, through the 
simple steps documented in the quick start guides on the Yocto Project 
website. As part of this learning process I came up with a utility that 
helps in visualizing and understanding the parallel distribution of the 
various bitbake tasks across the build machine, as well as providing 
some additional metrics and reports. More details available here:
http://www.electric-cloud.com/blog/2013/05/10/yoctoopenembedded-bitbake-build-visualization/

As-is, my thinking is this may be useful for the wider bitbake and Yocto 
communities, hence I wanted to share on these mailing lists.
If there is value here, are there other features or capabilities that 
would be worthwhile to consider? Any other thoughts or feedback?

Disclaimer: ElectricInsight, (the visualization part of this utility) is 
free but proprietary software, currently gated behind a simple 
registration form linked from the URL above.

Thanks

David Rosen

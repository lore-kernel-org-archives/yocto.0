TL;DR version
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

If you want to get everything needed to run a yocto build:

- clone the bootstrap repository (ask your distribution maintainer where =
it is):
    $ git clone bootstrap_repo_uri

- run 'setup-layers' from that repo:
    $ /path/to/bootstrap_repo/setup-layers

If you want to save the layers setup for replication elsewhere:

- save the config file and the replication script into a 'bootstrap repos=
itory')
(this can be an organization-specific yocto layer, or a standalone reposi=
tory):
    $ bitbake-layers create-layers-setup /path/to/bootstrap_repo

- document where the bootstrap repository can be found for your users

What is this layer setup tooling? (the long version)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D

Once you have a working build with the correct set of layers, it is benef=
icial
to capture the layer setup --- what they are, which repositories they com=
e from
and which SCM revisions they're at --- into a configuration file, so that=
 this
setup can be easily replicated later, perhaps on a different machine. Her=
e's
how to do this::

   $ bitbake-layers create-layers-setup /srv/work/alex/meta-alex/
   NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
   NOTE: Created /srv/work/alex/meta-alex/setup-layers.json
   NOTE: Created /srv/work/alex/meta-alex/setup-layers

The tool needs a single argument which tells where to place the output, c=
onsisting
of a json formatted layer configuration, and a ``setup-layers`` script th=
at can use that configuration
to restore the layers in a different location, or on a different host mac=
hine. The argument
can point to a custom layer (which is then deemed a "bootstrap" layer tha=
t needs to be
checked out first), or into a completely independent location.

The replication of the layers is performed by running the ``setup-layers`=
` script provided
above:

1. Clone the bootstrap layer or some other repository to obtain
   the json config and the setup script that can use it.

2. Run the script directly with no options::

      alex@Zen2:/srv/work/alex/my-build$ meta-alex/setup-layers
      Note: not checking out source meta-alex, use --force-bootstraplayer=
-checkout to override.

.. note::

   This will work to update an existing checkout as well.

.. note::
   The script is self-sufficient and requires only python3
   and git on the build machine.

.. note::
   Both the ``create-layers-setup`` and the ``setup-layers`` provided sev=
eral additional options
   that customize their behavior - you are welcome to study them via ``--=
help`` command line parameter.

1. Why JSON, and not YAML?

JSON is a part of the python standard library, while YAML is not. This me=
ans you can bootstrap a build on just about any
machine that has python and its core library, without first having to ins=
tall any dependencies. JSON not quite as easy
on the eye, but with decent indentation it's totally ok.

Before anyone asks, XML is appallingly difficult to read by modern standa=
rds of readability. No thanks.

2. I don't want the script in the bootstrap repo, just the config. I will=
 provide my own tools. How?

Use --json-only to generate only the config, and not the script:

    $ bitbake-layers create-layers-setup -json-only /srv/work/alex/meta-a=
lex/

3. I want to generate the compatible json with my own tools. Is there a s=
chema to validate it?

There is:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/tree/meta/files/layers.schema.json

You can use python3-jsonschema package to check the validity.

4. I don't want the json or the script, and would want to use an entirely=
 different format and tools. Is
'create-layers-setup' hardcoded to the OE json format?

Actually not! Other formats can be added through a plugin mechanism. OE j=
son writer is just
the default plugin but others can be implemented and selected:

    --writer {oe-setup-layers}, -w {oe-setup-layers}
                        Choose the output format (defaults to oe-setup-la=
yers).

5. I want to use something else than hardcoded revisions in the json (e.g=
. refer to branch
names or tags).

No problem! Edit the json to say 'main' or 'release-x.y'. Anything that '=
git checkout' can take will
work. Just be careful that these modification are not overwritten later b=
y 'create-layers-setup' by
e.g. renaming the json file first.

6. I already have an existing checkout and want to update it to the lates=
t greatest. How?

First, update the bootstrap repository to the latest (or otherwise desire=
d) revision to
obtain the latest versions of the script, and the json config. Ask the di=
stro maintainers
for the recommended practice to do so.

Then, run the script again - it should be able to handle a layers checkou=
t that already
exists, and update everything accoriding to the latest json, obtained in =
the first step.

7. Ok, I have checked out all the layers. Now what?

The next step is to actually set up a yocto build from an existing config=
uration template,
and start a bitbake session. This is made separate from handling the laye=
r repositories and
will be described separately.

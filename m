OK, I've taken the opportunity to summarise the tasks in meta-oe on the 
following page:

 http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Meta-oe_tasks

meta-oe's task-basic indeed contains much less than task-base; it provides an 
alternative (and possibly simpler) means of selecting between ssh or dropbear, 
although it prevents it being an image-level decision if that's something 
people care about. I'm not convinced it's appropriate to unconditionally 
install avahi, htop and cpufrequtils though - those look distro-specific to me.

For meta-oe's task-boot, it doesn't seem all that different from task-core-boot 
with the exception that task-core-boot imposes modutils-initscripts (should 
probably be fixed), and that task-boot mandates that the kernel be installed 
which is not always needed depending on how the bootloader works on whatever 
machine is being built for - although kernel.bbclass seems to indicate that 
currently the machine is supposed to influence this by setting RDEPENDS_kernel-
base which seems a little backwards to me.

I'd like to hear from other users of these tasks (Martin?)

If you're referring to qemu-config (which depends on distcc, task-core-nfs-
server, oprofileui-server, rsync and bash) it's important to note that it only 
gets enabled for qemu* machines by the poky distro config via POKYQEMUDEPS, so 
this is not being used by OE-Core - in fact nothing in OE-Core refers to qemu-
config at all. I still have an open bug to fix this (#1690), and I agree it's 
egregious, but it's a Poky issue, not an OE-Core one. For the record, the 
reason for including them is not "our testing team needs it!!!" - it was the 
assumption made a long time ago that these things would be generally useful 
for development on emulated targets. Whether or not that assumption is still 
correct is another issue.

Cheers,
Paul

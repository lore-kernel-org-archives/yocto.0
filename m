Sorry for the delay in replying to this. There are multiple reasons, I
partly wanted to try and give time for others to experiment with this.
I'm all too aware that when something merges, there will be a ton of
"complaints" about choices that were made. I'd hoped by giving people
time, they might be able to experiment with it but that clearly (and
sadly) isn't happening. We'll therefore have to make do with our best
guesses and instinct.

My first comment coming back to this is that I don't think we should
default to $HOME/builds as that is hard to discover (I got there via an
error message). I think we should error saying the user hadn't
configured a default and tell them how to, or to use --build-dir. That
implies the tool will need some user config file, but I suspect we're
going to need that anyway.

I'd also note that:

"bitbake-setup init poky-alex --build-dir /xxx/poky-alex"

crashes (i.e. when the dir =3D=3D config name).

I think the init process needs to tell the user what it is doing.=C2=A0Part
of our aim here is to shortcut things for the user but to also give
them the option of learning how/what to do for themselves.

At the moment you get a load of git clone output but not a real idea of
*what* it does. I'm thinking improving the output to something like:


**** Cloning OE-Core and layers ****

Cloning XXX to /dest/path

[git clone output]

Cloning XXX2 to /dest/path2

[git clone output]

**** Configuring build defaults ****

Adding layer XXXX

Setting up configuration in /dest/path/local.conf

**** Summary ****

Metadata setup in directory: XXX
Build directory configured as: YYY

Shortcut environment: ". /xxx/init-build-env"
Expanded environment setup: ". /xxx/yyy/oe-init-build-env <builddir>"

Run path/to/build.sh to execute the default build targets for this configur=
ation
or source the environment to run builds from the commandline.


We can always have a quiet option for people who don't want some of
this but I think it should default to telling people what it is doing
and in particular, *where* on disk it is putting things which I think
is my real aim here - let people navigate.

I suspect leaving the option is probably the best option but we need to
resolve the "default" issue as mentioned above which is perhaps my
bigger concern.

I think we're going to need some kind of config even to resolve the
issue above so this is going to be a must have.

I like the idea of backups and leaving it around. In theory we should
have compatibility.

Hopefully my above answers make sense.

I'm not shocked at all, I use mcedit a lot myself :)

Okay, that's sort of what I figured, but I thought I'd ask anyway.  I
would love it as a layer maintainer to have a single dashboard I could
log into and get the whole view.  It may be that this is something I
rarely use anyway, though, in comparison to patchworks, so the effort of
connecting these two pieces isn't worth it.

I don't know?  :-)  Honestly, not really all that sure what I'm looking
at here, but I'm thinking that if making updates in the interface to
layer information is tied to an email address, it'd be convenient for me
to log in as one username and have both my common email addresses
associated with it (with one being the primary, I guess).  Or to have
the ability to change the email address as necessary.

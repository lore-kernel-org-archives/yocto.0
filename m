Hi Nicolas,

Apologies for the delayed reply.

I have included solutions for these two in my proposal. However, I am a bit 
concerned about it being used in the way you describe above. The main aim is 
to provide tools for developers to test their changes on the target easily; if 
people start using it to produce images that they then send to other people 
(particularly customers or other organisations) then the potential end-game is 
an image used in production is one produced from a single developer's machine, 
at which point you may have some reproducibility issues - "where's the source 
for package xyz?" "Erm, not sure, that developer left six months ago..."

Of course there's nothing we'll really be able to do to stop people from using 
the tools in this way, so it's mainly going to be an exercise in documenting 
the right way to use them. It's worth thinking about these problems though 
especially if you want to encourage best practices.

We're certainly aiming to take care of these last two - indeed #4 is one of 
the main drivers behind the proposed new SDK.

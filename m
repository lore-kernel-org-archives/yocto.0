Indeed, and I think we would for compatibility purposes.

I think so as well. We may be pulling in one or two packages unconditionally 
where they should be optional (e.g. modutils-initscripts?) but most of it is 
pretty sensible.

The main concern with LSB is that we have something called task-basic, which 
seems to be intended for LSB but does not state as much, and I know at least 
one person has tried to use it and then been a little puzzled as to why rpm 
has been pulled in when ipk packaging has been selected. Just naming some of 
these tasks more appropriately would help avoid such situations. In the 
specific case of task-basic there may be a case for creating a similar but not 
LSB-focused task that pulls in real shell utilities in preference to the light 
versions provided by busybox.

The first part seems reasonable to me; but I'm still short of an answer as to 
what to do with the existing IMAGE_FEATURES code as mentioned above. At the 
moment aside from the special features such as debug-tweaks, these are just a 
thin layer on top of task recipes which doesn't add very much at all other 
than extra maintenance.

OK, that's a good point. I have another task on my list to clean up our image 
recipes and that would be a good segue into that.

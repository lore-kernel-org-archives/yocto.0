The idea is to avoid having to bbappend busybox and other recipes
basically. I can see how "tiny" is different than "ipv4" as it isn't
explicit it what it enables, making it a "grab-bag" as you put it.

I could come up with a term that describes systems without complex init
systems that need to be able to setup their own shells easily.

Another approach would be to just consider these two features and decide
if they shouldn't just be part of the oe-core busybox defconfig anyway.
I don't see why setsid shouldn't be. I can see arguments against
cttyhack (as it is a hack), but I wouldn't think either should be a huge
deal to just include. I thought the DISTRO_FEATURE was a reasonable
compromise between that and having to maintain a bbappend outside of
oe-core.

How would you feel about just including these two features in the
defconfig then?

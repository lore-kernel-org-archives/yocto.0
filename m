>
> YP 4.0.7 and YP 4.2 M2 are in QA
> We switched to the 6.1 kernel by default for M2. Unfortunately there are =
a couple of intermittent issues that seem to have crept in. One is a reprod=
ucibility issue in perf, likely with some host component causing it as it o=
nly occurs on second builds. The second appears to be an intermittent netwo=
rking issue accessing a python http-server for testing dnf which appeared a=
fter the kernel version change.
> We are continuing to see other intermittent failures which are limiting h=
ow quickly we can merge changes. A summary of some of the key issues was se=
nt to the mailing list: https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/=
message/176476
> There have been changes to the way the codeparser cache in bitbake stores=
 data which should reduce cache size, reduce the times data needs to be wri=
tten out and generally help performance.
> CVE levels in master are still high but there are patches in progress for=
 most issues as I understand it.
> We have a growing number of bugs in bugzilla, any help with them is appre=
ciated.

Please do notice there's a new public article by RP:
https://www.linux.com/audience/maintainer-confidential-opportunities-and-ch=
allenges-of-the-ubiquitous-but-under-resourced-yocto-project/

"Maintainer confidential: Opportunities and challenges of the
ubiquitous but under-resourced Yocto Project.
Maintainers are an important topic of discussion. I=E2=80=99ve read a few
perspectives, but I=E2=80=99d like to share mine as one of the lesser-known
maintainers in the open source world."

LWN has picked it up as well:
https://lwn.net/Articles/921646
(many of the comments are the usual 'yocto is hard' fare, which should
be treated like the weather - inevitable)

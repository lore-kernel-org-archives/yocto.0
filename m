When I suggested filesystem activity I was suggesting getting a kernel
filesystem and a physical I/O device to be active.
The load above is just two character devices so not a ton of kernel
code is active.

If you are interested in pursuing this further I would write a script
that writes multiple files to MMC and then deletes them and do this in
a loop.

Perhaps Bruce knows if there is already a test like this in the
rt-tests.

I believe cyclictest requires HR timers for proper operation.
This may explain the very strange numbers for standard kernel below.

Yes, the RT numbers now look reasonable.

The standard kernel numbers are way out.  I can't believe the average
latency on an idle system was 5 minutes. Perhaps the dependency on HR
timers is more than I expect and without it the numbers are just
bonkers. I would have expected the numbers to have a floor near the tick 
rate w/o HR.
Bruce: Is that really what that number means??

The loaded numbers are smaller for RT and std.  Strange.
It might be that the "load" is not very significant.
Its not really the CPU load that were after.  Instead we are trying to 
activate code paths that have premtption disabled due to critical
sections and locks.

I don't know if your are interested in taking this to ground, but if so 
I would enable HR in std and try a load as I suggest above or is
already included in the rt-tests.
Bruce certainly knows more about this than I do and might suggest a
load script.

Is your test code userspace or kernel space?
You can look at cyclictest to see if you missed something.
The RT wiki also has some examples for RT apps.

That sounds reasonable to me.

Chris,

I'm just wondering why do you even need gcc-4.5? Unless you specifically use  
gcc-4.5 based toolchain with meta-arago. That is the only reason I keep 
gcc-4.5 recipes in meta-arago to support old products with old toolchains. 
We've moved to 4.7 Linaro quite some time ago - when you use that, you won't  
need to download 4.5 version.

If you really need gcc-4.5 and it's not just a misconfiguration, then I have 
a tarball available that can be uploaded to a mirror...

3. layer based repository splitting.
--
When having multiple users of a base repository. Ease management of=20
customized repos, by having he ability to mark layers as "split layers",=20
this would yield a separate repo per "split layer", which would contain=20
packages modified/created by this layer.

Said packages would also be built for the base repo, but without=20
split-layer modifications.

A customized distro would use a compound of the base repo + split repo,=20
where the split repo would have higher priority.

I guess this could mean one deploy directory per split-layer.

I loaded the system effectively and also changed my rt application to 
use asynchronous IO - I find the rt kernel is much tighter at periodic 
latency yet seems to be worse in the latency measurements. I'm asuming 
the non-deteministic nature of userland file IO operations is causing 
the additional latency, even when using aio. Setting the IO scheduler 
did not have an effect.

Results show periodic timer latency in microseconds & interrupt latency 
in microseconds.

Realtime
Min        -324.0833333    159.75
Max        367.8333333        526.4166667
Avg        0.587306337        206.8056595

Standard
Min        -608.6666667    123.75
Max        612                448.0833333
Avg        0.5557039        153.5281784

All help appreciated,
Steve

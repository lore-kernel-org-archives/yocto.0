That is the intent but we don't currently have the tooling to make repos
per external layer work nicely for the end user (not that I think its
too hard to create). This repo give us a way to experiment with
splitting things up whilst still not hurting the end user experience too
much.

So its not the final solution, just what I think might be a good way to
start hashing things out.

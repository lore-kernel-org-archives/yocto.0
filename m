Hi,

When I drop into a devshell for an unpacked SRV_REV from a particular
git SRC_URI I have the git remote origin set to a local archive in the
~/downloads tree.

Is there a build variable, say, I can set to leave the original git
remote set as well so that I can more easily push back changes I make?

(Or is that a bad idea for some reason?)

Thanks,

Alex

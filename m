Also the period between submitting the updates, and having them show up =
in master is sometimes less than ideal, even when the freeze is not in =

I agree with both of you. I guess that makes me a transistor that =
can=E2=80=99t decide which path to choose :)

For meta-perl and meta-python, I am striving to run once a week, but =
that isn=E2=80=99t intended to send email out to any maintainers, it is =
just for my own accounting. It gets very messy with in-flight patches, =
which I hope to fix by using git-pw to not include packages that already =
have an upgrade in review. It is also optimistic for me to personally =
fix the 20+ packages that need updates at any given moment. This is why =
I need run time testing to give me better confidence in auto-upgraded =
recipes. Working on it :)

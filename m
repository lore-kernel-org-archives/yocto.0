While being able to support ssh (or a related protocol) is useful, you ne=
ed to=20
also remember that MANY MANY organizations absolutely block SSH access th=
rough=20
their firewalls.  So _requiring_ sftp would be bad.  Allowing it's usage =
would=20
be good.

As for logging in, https is transport 'security' but not authentication w=
ithout=20
additional helpers.  I think it's absolutely reasonable to say https acce=
ss=20
either needs an external helper for authentication purposes or it's=20
un-authenticated.  If you want (internal to the company) then ssh/sftp or=
=20
similar using the ssh-agent (or similar) should be the suggested approach.

We don't want to exclude anyone, but we want to be clear on the limitatio=
ns=20
based on an organization's specific choice.

In my experience you do not use _one_ sstate-cache for multiple projects =
(at an=20
organization level), each project is responsible for it's own cache.  Thi=
s=20
prevents even the possibility that one project could use code not intende=
d for it.

 From a more generic Yocto Project perspective, this means you really wan=
t to=20
use a hierarchy of sstate-caches.  (Maybe not a true hierarchy.). I.e. I =
use YP,=20
so I get the YP sstate-cache for the base functionality.  I use=20
meta-openembedded, so I want the meta-openembedded cache... project A, I =
want=20
the project's cache, OE and YP caches as well..  project B, I want that p=
rojects=20
cache, OE and YP caches.  Project C?  I might want it's cache, Project A,=
=20
Project B, and OE and YP.   You can see this gets complicated quickly.

If this either isn't inteded or a good idea, then alternatives need to be=
=20
provided for this.  Everyone always ends up with an upstream provider (or=
=20
providers) be it YP, OE, OSVs, ISVs, local company resources, etc.  How d=
o we=20
manage this and keep it aligned?

Bring in hash equivalency and PR service and things get complicated.  The=
=20
sstate-cache itself is NOT separable from those services.  There are ways=
 to=20
decouple them, but they can be 'extreme'.  I.e. turn off hash-equivalency=
, no=20
need for a hash-equivalency service.   Don't cache the do_package_write* =
files,=20
no PR service....  (but even that isn't fool proof due to git AUTOINC... =
so you=20
end up seeding the AUTOINC with static entries or some other method...)

All of these items need to be dealt with and documented together.  My PER=
SONAL=20
preference, (without knowing any specific implementation details) is that=
 the=20
contents of hash-equivalency and PR service is somehow stored with the ss=
tate-cache.

One possible way this could be done..  System starts up, determines it ne=
eds=20
something it doesn't have, then goes out and checks if an updated index i=
s=20
present.  If it is, downloads it adds to it's hash equivalency server.  I=
f no=20
index present, it can then look for the file lets say "sstate:....link". =
 If=20
that comes back, we know we have an equivalency, it's downloaded added to=
 the=20
local database and then the pointed to file is retrieved..  (.siginfo and=
=20
.tar.xz or whatever).  This would ensure that the index is an optimizatio=
n, but=20
not a requirement and would allow a "live" sstate-cache while losing some=
=20
performance.  (This doesn't negate any of the comments about rights or=20
possibility to DoS a server via too many connections!)

Still have to solve the PR service problem, but this could get 'seeded' v=
ia the=20
associated do_write_package siginfo or similar..  and for the AUTOINC, se=
ed it=20
from the siginfo file for a given hash?

Doing something like the above could then allow the order specificed in t=
he=20
SSTATE_MIRRORS to be used to truely indicate the order things are resolve=
d and=20
loaded.

The more I've thought about this, any sort of query directly to a remote=20
hashservice seems more and more problematic..  Local hash database, absol=
utely=20
needed as an optimization.

There is a second problem.  My org for instant, it's easy for me to reque=
st=20
https server where I can serve files to the public.  But asking for our I=
T to=20
support a hash equivalency (and pr) server?  This will likely take months=

negotiation, possible security review, mitigation process, etc etc etc.. =
and no=20
guaranty that it will actually get approved.  I expect other people will =

similar situation.

Using the standard download model/approach we already have a "generic" me=
tadata=20
server approach (and standard download URI supported by bitbake).  The=20
specialized approaches (prserver/hashserver) are where we run into issues=
=20
because it's no longer "generic" and well understood by others.  Need to =
figure=20
out a way for this all to work and allow the most "reasonable" re-use we =
can.

FWIW, we did have a similar issue with do_fetch overloading
servers/proxies/ISPs and added:

do_fetch[number_threads] =3D "4"

Finding the right place to put a thread limit on overall setscene tasks
is harder but in theory possible. Or perhaps a "network capable tasks"
thread limit?

Is the overload caused by the initial query of sstate presence, or,
does it happen when the setscene tasks themselves run?

Is this sstate over http(s) or something else? I seem to remember you
mentioning sftp. If this were using sftp, it would be horribly slow as
it was designed for a light overhead "does this exist?" check which
http(s) can manage well.

Recently we've been wondering about teaching the hashequiv server about
"presence", which would then mean the build would only query things
that stood a good chance of existing.

Explaining to users they need to do X before Y quickly gets tiring,
both for people explaining it and the people doing it trying to
remember. I'd really like to get to a point where the system "does the
right thing" if we can.

I don't believe the problems you describe are insurmountable. If you
are using sftp, that is going to be a big chunk of the problem as the
system assumes something faster is available. Yes, I've taken patches
to make sftp work but it isn't recommended at all. I appreciate there
would be reasons why you use sftp but if it is possible to get a list
of "available sstate" via other means, it would improve things.

What determines this availability? I worry that is something very
fragile and specific to your use case. It is also not an all or nothing
binary thing.

That isn't correct and isn't going to work. If I make a single change
locally, there is a good chance that 99.9% of the sstate could still be
valid in some cases. Forcing the user through 10 hours of rebuild when
potentially that much was available is a really really bad user
experience.

Remember bblock and bbunlock too. These provide a way to fix or unlock
specific sections of the codebase. Usually a developer has a pretty
good idea of which bits they want to allow to change. I don't think
people have yet realised/explored the potential these offer.

Cheers,

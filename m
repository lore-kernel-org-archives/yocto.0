Specially the part that end user should care

Howto to set local packages repositories and to share the sstate data stuff
to speed builds.

&gt; the default approach people take whenever they hit problems.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For a long time we&#39;ve wanted to find ways to do this better and ha=
ve<br>
&gt; better incremental build support. It can be split into some related<br=
>
&gt; problems:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; a) How do we work out which pieces of the system have not changed and<=
br>
&gt; which have changed?<br>
&gt; b) How do we then remove and replace the pieces that have changed?<br>
&gt; c) How do we use prebuilt components that don&#39;t need to be built f=
rom<br>
&gt; scratch if they&#39;re available?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We now have answers to the questions:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; a) We detect changes in the &quot;inputs&quot; to a given task by crea=
ting a<br>
&gt; checksum/signature of those inputs. If the checksum/signature changes,=
<br>
&gt; the inputs changed and we need to rerun it.<br>
&gt; b) The shared state (sstate) code tracks which tasks added which outpu=
t<br>
&gt; to the build process. This means the output from a given task can be<b=
r>
&gt; removed/upgraded or otherwise manipulated.<br>
&gt; c) This question is also addressed partly by b) assuming we can fetch<=
br>
&gt; the sstate objects from remote locations and install them if they&#39;=
re<br>
&gt; deemed to be valid.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m now proud to announce that we have all these pieces in place a=
nd<br>
&gt; working. Its not a simple problem and I&#39;m not going to claim its a=
ll bug<br>
&gt; free but the architecture is there, we&#39;ve tested it and fixed many=
 of<br>
&gt; the problems. This is by far the most complete and robust answer to th=
e<br>
&gt; above questions we&#39;ve ever had, replacing ideas like the several<b=
r>
&gt; versions of packaged-staging that predate this.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Since its new, this subject is lacking in documentation and I&#39;d<br=
>
&gt; therefore like to dive into some of the technical details so these hav=
e<br>
&gt; at least been covered somewhere. I&#39;m going to tell this partly as =
a<br>
&gt; story of how we&#39;ve arrived at the design we have today. Over time =
we can<br>
&gt; expand this and include the data in the manuals etc.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Overall Architecture<br>
&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Firstly, we&#39;ve made a decision to make all this work on a per-task=
<br>
&gt; basis. In previous versions of packaged-staging we did this on a per<b=
r>
&gt; recipe basis but this didn&#39;t work well. Why? Imagine you have the =
ipk<br>
&gt; packaging backend enabled and you switch to deb. Your do_install and<b=
r>
&gt; do_package output is still valid but a per recipe approach wouldn&#39;=
t<br>
&gt; include the .deb files so you&#39;d have to invalidate the whole thing=
 and<br>
&gt; re-run it. This is suboptimal. You also end up having to teach the cor=
e<br>
&gt; an awful lot of knowledge about specific tasks. This doesn&#39;t scale=
 well<br>
&gt; and doesn&#39;t allow users to add new tasks easily in layers or exter=
nal<br>
&gt; recipes without touching the packaged-staging core.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Checksums/Signatures<br>
&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So we need to detect all the inputs to a given task. For shell tasks<b=
r>
&gt; this turns out to be fairly easily as we generate the &quot;run&quot; =
shell script<br>
&gt; for each task and its possible to checksum that and have a good idea o=
f<br>
&gt; when the data going into a task changes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; To complicate the problem, there are things we don&#39;t want to inclu=
de in<br>
&gt; the checksum. Firstly, there is the actual specific build path of a<br=
>
&gt; given task (its WORKDIR). We don&#39;t really mind if that changes as =
that<br>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t affect the output for target packages and we also have t=
he<br>
&gt; objective of making native/cross packages relocatable. We therefore ne=
ed<br>
&gt; to exclude WORKDIR. The simplistic approach is therefore to set WORKDI=
R<br>
&gt; to some fixed value and checksum that &quot;run&quot; script. The next=
 problem is<br>
&gt; the &quot;run&quot; scripts were rather full of functions that may or =
may not get<br>
&gt; called. Chris Larson added code which allowed us to figure out<br>
&gt; dependencies between shell functions and we use this to prune the &quo=
t;run&quot;<br>
&gt; scripts down to the minimum set, thereby alleviating this problem and<=
br>
&gt; making the &quot;run&quot; scripts much more readable as an added bonu=
s.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So we have something that would work for shell, what about python task=
s?<br>
&gt; These are harder but the same approach applies, we needed to figure ou=
t<br>
&gt; what variables a python function accesses and what functions it calls.=
<br>
&gt; Again, Chris Larson came up with some code for this and this is exactl=
y<br>
&gt; what we do, figure out the variable and function dependencies, then<br=
>
&gt; checksum the data that goes as an input to the task.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Like the WORKDIR case, there are some cases where we do explicitly wan=
t<br>
&gt; to ignore a dependency as we know better than bitbake. This can be don=
e<br>
&gt; with a line like:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; PACKAGE_ARCHS[vardepsexclude] =3D &quot;MACHINE&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; which would ensure that the PACKAGE_ARCHS variable does not depend on<=
br>
&gt; the value of MACHINE, even if it does reference it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Equally, there are some cases where we need to add in dependencies<br>
&gt; bitbake isn&#39;t able to find which can be done as:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; PACKAGE_ARCHS[vardeps] =3D &quot;MACHINE&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; which would explicitly add the MACHINE variable as a dependency for<br=
>
&gt; PACKAGE_ARCHS. There are some cases with inline python for example whe=
re<br>
&gt; bitbake isn&#39;t able to figure out the dependencies. When running in=
 debug<br>
&gt; mode (-DDD), bitbake does output information when it sees something it=
<br>
&gt; can&#39;t figure out the dependencies within. We currently have not ma=
naged<br>
&gt; to cover those dependencies in detail and this is something we know we=
<br>
&gt; need to fix.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This covers the direct inputs into a task well but there is then the<b=
r>
&gt; question of the indirect inputs, the things that were already built an=
d<br>
&gt; present in the build directory. The information so far is referred to =
as<br>
&gt; the &quot;basehash&quot; in the code, we then need to add the hashes o=
f all the<br>
&gt; tasks this task depends upon. Choosing which dependencies to add is a<=
br>
&gt; policy decision but the effect is to generate a master<br>
&gt; checksum/signature which combines the basehash and the hashes of the<b=
r>
&gt; dependencies.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Figuring out the dependencies and these signatures/checksums is great,=
<br>
&gt; what do we then do with the checksum information? We&#39;ve introduced=
 the<br>
&gt; notion of a signature handler into bitbake which is responsibility for=
<br>
&gt; processing this information. By default there is a dummy &quot;noop&qu=
ot;<br>
&gt; signature handler enabled in bitbake so behaviour is unchanged from<br=
>
&gt; previous versions. OECore uses the &quot;basic&quot; signature hander =
by setting:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER ?=3D &quot;basic&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; in bitbake.conf. At the same point we also give bitbake some extra<br>
&gt; information to help it handle this information:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST ?=3D &quot;TMPDIR FILE PATH PWD BB_TASKHASH BBPA=
TH DL_DIR SSTATE_DIR THISDIR FILESEXTRAPATHS FILE_DIRNAME HOME LOGNAME SHEL=
L TERM USER FILESPATH USERNAME STAGING_DIR_HOST STAGING_DIR_TARGET&quot;<br=
>

&gt; BB_HASHTASK_WHITELIST ?=3D &quot;(.*-cross$|.*-native$|.*-cross-initia=
l$|.*-cross-intermediate$|^virtual:native:.*|^virtual:nativesdk:.*)&quot;<b=
r>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST is effectively a list of global<br>
&gt; vardepsexclude, those variables are never included in any checksum. Th=
is<br>
&gt; is actually where we exclude WORKDIR since WORKDIR is constructed as a=
<br>
&gt; path within TMPDIR and we whitelist TMPDIR.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The BB_HASHTASK_WHITELIST covers dependent tasks and excludes certain<=
br>
&gt; kinds of tasks from the dependency chains. The effect of the example<b=
r>
&gt; above is to isolate the native, target and cross components, so for<br=
>
&gt; example, toolchain changes don&#39;t force a rebuild of the whole syst=
em.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The end result of the &quot;basic&quot; handler is to make some depend=
ency and<br>
&gt; hash information available to the build. This includes:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; BB_BASEHASH_task-&lt;taskname&gt; - the base hashes for each task in t=
he recipe<br>
&gt; BB_BASEHASH_&lt;filename:taskname&gt; - the base hashes for each depen=
dent task<br>
&gt; BBHASHDEPS_&lt;filename:taskname&gt; - The task dependencies for each =
task<br>
&gt; BB_TASKHASH - the hash of the currently running task<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; There is also a &quot;basichash&quot; BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER which is th=
e same as<br>
&gt; the basic version but adds the task hash to the stamp files. This has<=
br>
&gt; the result that any metadata change that changes the task hash,<br>
&gt; automatically causes the task to rerun. This removes the need to bump =
PR<br>
&gt; values and changes to metadata automatically ripple across the build.<=
br>
&gt; This isn&#39;t the default but its likely we&#39;ll do that in future =
and all<br>
&gt; the functionality exists. The reason for delaying is the potential<br>
&gt; impact to distribution feed creation as they need increasing PR fields=
<br>
&gt; and we lack a mechanism to automate that yet. Its not a hard problem t=
o<br>
&gt; fix though.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Shared State<br>
&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;ve talked a lot about part a) of the problem above and how we de=
tect<br>
&gt; changes to the tasks. This solves half the problem, the other half is<=
br>
&gt; using this information at the build level and being able to reuse or<b=
r>
&gt; rebuild specific components.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The sstate class is a relatively generic implementation of how to<br>
&gt; &quot;capture&quot; a snapshot of a given task. The idea is that from =
the build<br>
&gt; point of view we should never need to care where this output came from=
,<br>
&gt; it could be freshly built, it could be downloaded and unpacked from<br=
>
&gt; somewhere, we should never need to care.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; There are two classes of output, one is just about creating a director=
y<br>
&gt; in WORKDIR, e.g. the output of do_install or do_package. The other is<=
br>
&gt; where a set of data is merged into a shared directory tree such as the=
<br>
&gt; sysroot.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We&#39;ve tried to keep the gory details of the implementation hidden =
in the<br>
&gt; sstate class. From a user perspective, adding sstate wrapping to a tas=
k<br>
&gt; is as simple as this do_deploy example taken from do_deploy.bbclass:<b=
r>
&gt;<br>
&gt; DEPLOYDIR =3D &quot;${WORKDIR}/deploy-${PN}&quot;<br>
&gt; SSTATETASKS +=3D &quot;do_deploy&quot;<br>
&gt; do_deploy[sstate-name] =3D &quot;deploy&quot;<br>
&gt; do_deploy[sstate-inputdirs] =3D &quot;${DEPLOYDIR}&quot;<br>
&gt; do_deploy[sstate-outputdirs] =3D &quot;${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; python do_deploy_setscene () {<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 sstate_setscene(d)<br>
&gt; }<br>
&gt; addtask do_deploy_setscene<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Here, we add some extra flags to the task, a name field (&quot;deploy&=
quot;), an<br>
&gt; input directory which is where the task outputs data to, the output<br=
>
&gt; directory which is where the data from the task should be eventually b=
e<br>
&gt; copied to. We also add a _setscene variant of the task and add the tas=
k<br>
&gt; name to the SSTATETASKS list.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If there was a directory you just need to ensure has its contents<br>
&gt; preserved, this can be done with a line like:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; do_package[sstate-plaindirs] =3D &quot;${PKGD} ${PKGDEST}&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Its also worth highlighting mutliple directories can be handled as abo=
ve<br>
&gt; or as in the following input/output example:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; do_package[sstate-inputdirs] =3D &quot;${PKGDESTWORK} ${SHLIBSWORKDIR}=
&quot;<br>
&gt; do_package[sstate-outputdirs] =3D &quot;${PKGDATA_DIR} ${SHLIBSDIR}&qu=
ot;<br>
&gt; do_package[sstate-lockfile] =3D &quot;${PACKAGELOCK}&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This also includes the ability to take a lockfile when manipulating<br=
>
&gt; sstate directory structures since some cases are sensitive to file<br>
&gt; additions/removals.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Behind the scenes, the sstate code works by looking in SSTATE_DIR and<=
br>
&gt; also at any SSTATE_MIRRORS for sstate files. An example of a local fil=
e<br>
&gt; url sstate mirror is:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; SSTATE_MIRRORS ?=3D &quot;\<br>
&gt; file://.* <a href=3D"http://someserver.tld/share/sstate/" target=3D"_b=
lank">http://someserver.tld/share/sstate/</a> \n \<br>
&gt; file://.* file:///some/local/dir/sstate/&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; although any standard PREMIRROR/MIRROR syntax can be used for example<=
br>
&gt; with http:// urls.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The sstate package validity can be detected just by looking at the<br>
&gt; filename since the filename contains the task checksum/signature as<br=
>
&gt; detailed above. If a valid sstate package is found, it will be<br>
&gt; downloaded and used to accelerate the task.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The task acceleration phase is what the *_setscene tasks are used for.=
<br>
&gt; Bitbake goes through this phase before the main execution code and tri=
es<br>
&gt; to accelerate any tasks it can find sstate packages for. If a sstate<b=
r>
&gt; package for a task is available, the sstate package will be used, that=
<br>
&gt; task will not be run and importantly, any dependencies that task will<=
br>
&gt; also not be executed.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As a real world example, the aim is when building an ipk based image,<=
br>
&gt; only the do_package_write_ipk tasks would have their sstate packages<b=
r>
&gt; fetched and extracted. Since the sysroot isn&#39;t used, it would neve=
r get<br>
&gt; extracted. This is another reason to prefer the task based approach<br=
>
&gt; sstate takes over any recipe based approach which would have to instal=
l<br>
&gt; the output from every task.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Tips and Tricks<br>
&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This isn&#39;t simple code and when it goes wrong, debugging needs to =
be<br>
&gt; straightforward. During development we tried to write strong debugging=
<br>
&gt; tools too.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Firstly, whenever a sstate package is written out, so is a<br>
&gt; corresponding .siginfo file. This is a pickled python database of all<=
br>
&gt; the metadata that went into creating the hash for a given sstate<br>
&gt; package.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If bitbake is run with the --dump-signatures (or -S) option, instead o=
f<br>
&gt; building the target package specified it will dump out siginfo files i=
n<br>
&gt; the stamp directory for every task it would have executed.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Finally, there is a bitbake-diffsigs command which can process these<b=
r>
&gt; siginfo files. If one file is specified, it will dump out the dependen=
cy<br>
&gt; information in the file. If two files are specified, it will compare t=
he<br>
&gt; two files and dump out the differences between the two.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This allows the question of &quot;What changed between X and Y?&quot; =
to be<br>
&gt; answered easily.<br>

I just wanted to update everyone on where we are at.  (I won't bore anyone with
any followups past this.)

IA32 (32-bit and 64-bit):

We believe the problems are resolved.  The error was a combination of prior
patch merge issues and a bug in glibc 2.22.  A patch for the glibc 2.22 has
already been sent to the GLIBC community and I have a change ready for OE.


ARM:

The same glibc 2.22 bug affected ARM as well as IA32.

Also it appears that a patch that went in last fall to enable IFUNC on arm
somehow had a hunk dropped from it.  Now that we've identified and restored this
hunk, it appears to be working again.


MIPS32/MIPS64 (o32, n32, n64):

A new section was added, SHT_MIPS_ABIFLAGS, this was confusing the prelinker
causing it to refused to continue.  A patch has gone in to instruct the
prelinker how to handle this new section (ignore it).


Power (32-bit):

We are still investigating changes that have happened in the past year+ to
binutils and glibc for Power systems.

Power (64-bit):

It is likely this will not work anytime soon.  The ABI has changed and is no
longer compatible with the previous methods of prelinking.  This is fairly low
priority to be fixed, as it's been broken for a while now.


If anyone has any expertise on Power 32-bit or 64-bit ELF, I'm still looking for
help there to get these issues resolved.

I saw the other patch after replying here. So this is causing some sort
of non Kconfig related error (i.e. host contamination) ? If so, that is
a different scenario than I was thinking of when I wrote this.

Either way, like I said in my other email, I'd like to understand why
this is popping up now, since I'm not seeing anything like it in my
builds .. with my recent changes, all that I've essentially done is
expose merge_config to the actual tasks, so if this is showing an error
I jiggled something else, or it was always around.

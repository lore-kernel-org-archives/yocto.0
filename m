OK, thanks. I'm certainly happy to have a wider discussion on this.

That's what I've been looking at - just using lava-dispatcher rather than the 
full LAVA framework. That said, if all it requires root for is mounting the 
image, modifying it and then unmounting it, to test our images I don't think 
we even want this; but there appears to be no way to disable it. I then found 
a launchpad bug where the root requirement was discussed and the accepted 
solution there was for the dispatcher to just check and error out if not 
running as root.

Our test code currently queries configuration/image information from the build 
system, which means that the build system has to be involved in the dispatch 
process. Our CI solution (the autobuilder) of course runs the build system 
though. One of the work items in my email is to be able to export the tests, 
thus decoupling them from this; the build system would still need to be in 
charge of exporting the tests, but it would allow a test server to manage the 
deployment, execution and results collection.

OK, fair enough - I guess the trouble here is it's hard to find any 
documentation talking about this functionality; everything I could find that 
talks about preparing an image refers to needing an hwpack and using linaro-
media-create. Even mailing list posts that I found (admittedly from last year) 
referred to these in the context of booting OE images; there are also hwpacks 
offered for download under "openembedded" directories on releases.linaro.org. 
Given these I hope you can understand my confusion.

Generally, if someone with experience of doing so successfully could document 
how LAVA can be set up to test OE images I think that would be very helpful. I 
did struggle a bit with the documentation - there are still quite a lot of 
broken links to the old documentation on readthedocs.org.

Right. FWIW, as you probably know, the way we handle "unsupported" host 
distros is to allow running on them, but warn the user that they may 
experience problems (well, in our case we provide this host distro check 
functionality, it's on in Poky and off in OE-Core by default, not sure if 
others are using it).

Cheers,
Paul

Alright, the real problem was that in glibc 2.19 the SPE patch was =
upsteamed from eglibc and now the SPE support lives under nofpu/ which =
is correct unlike
eglibc where it was living under fpu/ class. We were not passing =
=97without-fp
to eglibc configure which caused this issue. I have now fixed it in =
metadata
and pushed a new set of patches ( total 2) to the pull branch, which =
should take of this issue as well as valgrind issue.=20

Thanks

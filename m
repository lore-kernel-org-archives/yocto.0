  out of nowhere, a client of mine wants to port from WEC7 to linux
using YP; they already have a working app written in C# .NET and want
to drag it with them, obviously using mono.

  i see the YP wiki page on running .NET apps here:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Building_and_running_embedded_Linux_.NET_applications_from_first_principles

which looks like it has the info they need, given that i know
absolutely *zero* about C#/.NET/mono, but i might as well learn
something about it.

  the history of that page suggests it's actively supported, can
anyone confirm that it really does walk one through how to incorporate
a .NET app in a YP image? given some time this weekend, i'll try to
follow how to add and run a simple example. thanks.

Hi,
Currently there are two test runs that ensure the HOB is functioning correc=
tly, as following:
	- https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/tr_show_run.cgi?run_id=3D3479
	- https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/tr_show_run.cgi?run_id=3D3478

We also have some of the test cases automated can be run, but as Belen ment=
ioned earlier, HOB is being deprecated so we would have to see if they stil=
l run correctly on the latest master. Keep me posted if you want to run the=
m, maybe we can help.

Cheers,
AlexG

These are the test cases I can find in Testopia:

https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/tr_list_cases.cgi?searchstr=3Dhob&current=
_t
ab=3Dcase&summary_type=3Danywordssubstr&summary=3Dhob&field-1-0-0=3Dsummary=
&type-1-
0-0=3Danywordssubstr&value-1-0-0=3Dhob

Hopefully someone from QA can provide more details on how to run them.

If you want any input on how to present the new options in the UI, let me k=
now. I'll be happy to help.

Cheers

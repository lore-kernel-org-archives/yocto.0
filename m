Greetings,

As far as I understand, the list of distros that the Yocto Project 
supports (or should claim it supports) is the intersection of the list 
of sanity tested distros (SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS in 
meta-poky/conf/distro/poky.conf) and the distribution versions that are 
still publicly supported by their vendors (as checked on Wikipedia). 
There's no point in claiming to support a distribution for which package 
updates are no longer available.

Currently for master, this intersection is only:

  * Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS)
  * Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS)
  * Fedora 37
  * Debian GNU/Linux 11.x (Bullseye)
  * OpenSUSE Leap 15.4

Here are a few obvious absents here:

  * AlmaLinux: version 8.7 and 9.1 are still in SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS
    but they are obsolete. I see an AlmaLinux9 worker on
    https://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/typhoon/#/workers, but I don't
    know whether it's 9.1 or 9.2 (not obsolete unlike 9.1).
  * Fedora 38: important as Fedora 37 ends in November. I see a Fedora38
    worker, but there are still failed jobs, even though the majority
    are successful. When is a distro version ready to be added to
    SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS?.
  * Debian 12: we also have such a worker, with a mix of successful and
    failed builds. Is this version eligible too?
  * OpenSuse Leap 15.5, as OpenSuse Leap 15.4 expires in November too. I
    see a worker, but with only failed builds.

I'd say that the most urgent one is AlmaLinux 9.2 as otherwise we don't 
support AlmaLinux any more. The next ones for the end of the year are 
Fedora 38 and OpenSuse Leap 15.5.

Would you have any thoughts?

I was about to send a documentation update to declare that master (and 
probably Mickledore and Kirkstone) only support 5 different distribution 
versions, but a longer list would look better...

Thanks in advance
Cheers
Michael.

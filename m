Laverne 4.0.1 Errata
--------------------
Name: Laverne
Version: 4.0.1
MD5 Sum: 0564df3a756c7ccdf2b34e980e6f56d8
Tagged Rev: 45526f5ecfd7fec22ce8022b46c311e77ee0fa9f
Build Rev: fd7a07b3a2153826bedda2ef76b9a33ab2791680
Build Date: Jan 26 2011
Builder: autobuilder.pokylinux.org

Fixes
------------------------

    * Make 3.82, as shipped with Fedora 14, included parser bug fixes
that resulted in a much stricter parser. As a result, the Makefiles
could not be parsed for many of the software versions shipped with
Laverne. The Makefiles in the following recipes were fixed:

          o eglibc
          o busybox
          o procps
          o linux-libc-headers
          o gstreamer
          o gst-plugins
          o libowl-av
          o owl-video-widget
          o dates
          o contacts
          o web-webkit

    * The ability to build openssl-native on a system that has SELINUX
enabled was restored. (We disabled the execstack flag at compile time.)

    * A host-intrusion issue caused by a failure in QEMU to find zlib
headers during configure was fixed. The issue was causing qemu-native to
use the system zlib if it was present. If the system zlib was not
present the build would fail.

    * Stability and usability enhancements, which included handling
relative filesystem paths, were made to poky-qemu scripts.

    * The run-time remapping of package names when adding extra packages
to an image via the IMAGE_INSTALL mechanism were fixed.

    * The configure test in quilt for GNU patch was fixed to that it
correctly detects the version.

Known Issues
------------------------

    * The mpc3815e-rbd and routerstationpro machines were untested and
not a part of the official Laverne 4.0 release. These machines are still
unusable for this Laverne 4.0.1 release.
       o mpx3815e-rdb will not boot due to a kernel/uboot issue Bug #685
       o routerstation will not boot (by default) due to incorrect boot
         parameters Bug #681
       o routerstationpro debug messages related to the ethernet driver
         print during boot Bug #679

    * Shutdown/poweroff on qemuarm does not cleanly halt the virtual
machine. To workaround this issue use the reboot command. Using this
command avoids a "power-cycle" and instead cleanly shuts down the VM Bug
#684

    * Two "Connection Manager" icons appear in the Sato UI. This
duplication has been fixed in master. Note that you can use either icon
to launch the connectivity UI. Bug #683

    * The on-screen keyboard incorrectly launches in the qemumips
machine. This issue is due to a mis-configured formfactor file Bug #682

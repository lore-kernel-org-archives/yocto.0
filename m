Unfortunately, this OE meeting will be a business meeting followed by
a gathering for OE developers to help determine the direction of the
project and figure out who is doing what. It would not be ideal or
even interesting for beginners. Interested folks can sign up by adding
their name to the wiki at http://openembedded.org/wiki/OEDAM_2016

However, the Yocto Project Developer Day on Thursday of that week is
specifically designed as training for beginners and also interesting
presentations and labs for advanced folks.
https://yoctoproject.org/devday

I'd be happy to answer any specific questions on either event.

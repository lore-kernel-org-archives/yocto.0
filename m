More info for those that care ...

The end of the error log file has:
DEBUG: Executing python function write_image_manifest
DEBUG: Python function write_image_manifest finished
NOTE: Executing: ldconfig
-r/home/hutch/yocto_1.8_davinci_2/poky/build/tmp/work/am180x_evm-poky-linux-gnueabi/core-image-nodeam/1.0-r0/rootfs-c

I have a linux-dummy director in pkgdata but no kernel-depmod directory exists.

You are correct.  I assumed that the string was the same format as the 
SRC_URI.  This might be a little confusing for users as that means we 
have two different interpretations for repo strings.

Then what good is the key value for?  The current patch does not use 
r_name except to look up the value under layers.  Should we just make 
the JSON have this as an array of repos instead of a named hash?

Or is there some planned thing coming later that might make use of this key?

Ideally this would be locked to oe-core as that is what is intended. 
But I'm not sure how best to do that.


Side topic, would it make sense to allow for the existence of a config 
file in the repos that would allow them to "register" features that can 
processed by bitbake-setup to configure various things that the layer 
requires/offers?  Right now we do this kind of thing for the 
oe-setup-build script.  But I could see the framework being useful for 
this kind of thing.

I'll take a look today and try to track it down.

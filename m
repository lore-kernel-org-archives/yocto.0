I double checked over the weekend, and I have no problems with
linux-yocto + the meta-virtualization fragment and docker.

Did you say that you confirmed on target via /proc/config.gz that
all the options you tried to enable are still present in the running
kernel ?

You could, but without a reproducer on oe-core, chances are that it
won't be easily resolved.

At a glance, it isn't clear to me how systemd is causing your 
busybox-hwclock
issue. But if you check the list, that particular package has recently
been moved around/broken out. So I'd suggest making sure that all of
your layers are on the correct branches and that releases aren't being
mixed.

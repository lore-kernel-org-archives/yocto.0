What I think happened is that glibc simply got better at linking, optimised
the runtime bits to the fullest, and any benefits prelink may once have had
aren't there anymore. Which is IMO fine - I am terrified of custom address
arithmetic that's not really understood by anyone, and very easy to get
wrong, with devastating consequences. I spent more or less the whole day
stepping assembly in gdb to figure out what exactly is going wrong in that
ppc bug.

The value proposition of Yocto is still very strong, and is not at all
affected by dropping prelink, in my opinion.

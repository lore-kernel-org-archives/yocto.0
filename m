I went ahead and ran some quick benchmarks myself. Specifically:

1. Running 'free' after things have settled down at boot:

a) without prelink
core-image-sato-sdk
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache
available
Mem:          489352      152104      236284         472      100964
 323824
core-image-ptest-fast
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache
available
Mem:        1004680       43456      927688         256       33536
 941156

b) with prelink
core-image-sato-sdk
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache
available
Mem:          489352      153048      235544         468      100760
 322900
core-image-ptest-fast
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache
available
Mem:        1004680       44444      928128         256       32108
 940168

2. Running -c testimage

a) without prelink
core-image-sato-sdk () - Ran 66 tests in 96.693s
core-image-sato-sdk () - Ran 66 tests in 96.469s
core-image-sato-sdk () - Ran 66 tests in 94.994s
core-image-ptest-fast () - Ran 66 tests in 583.767s
core-image-ptest-fast () - Ran 66 tests in 576.564s
core-image-ptest-fast () - Ran 66 tests in 576.797s

b) with prelink
core-image-sato-sdk () - Ran 66 tests in 96.390s
core-image-sato-sdk () - Ran 66 tests in 96.615s
core-image-sato-sdk () - Ran 66 tests in 95.596s
core-image-ptest-fast () - Ran 66 tests in 576.248s
core-image-ptest-fast () - Ran 66 tests in 574.618s
core-image-ptest-fast () - Ran 66 tests in 576.760s

So the memory usage is actually *better* without prelink. And any timing
benefits are lost in statistical noise, in these tests at least.

So I do not think it is wrong to question the usefulness of this feature.
I'd like to hear Mark's take on this, as prelink-cross is primarily his
work, he's put a lot of effort into it, and I would want to know where the
benefits are. Note that Red Hat abandoned prelink in 2013, and
prelink-cross likewise hasn't seen any commits for two years.

Alex

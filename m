We can try things to push users out of github :
* Leaving a fake PR at the top of the list with a title along the line of
"Please don't open a PR but instead go to <contributing guide link>"
* using the PR template (the text pre-filled for the new PR description) to
convey the same info
* A bot that automatically answer the PRs with a comment with the same idea
(the bot could also close the PR but that might be a bit harsh)

Richard/Saul,

Paul Gortmaker maintains the upstream 2.6.34.x -longerm tree. The
yocto stable kernel tracks this tree and incorporates those nominated
changes. We are picking up lots of bug fixes and security updates
to the -stable tree with this change.

This commit updates the BSP SRCREVs to the latest 2.6.34.x
merge and picks up 260 -stable commits for each BSP.

Tom: the meta-emenlow layer should be updated with the new SRCREV.
I updated the master version, and simply tossed any changes to the
drivers modified by the emenlow. So taking a quick look at the merge
might be a good idea as well. I did my own build tests here and
everything looked sane.

Darren: I had to resolve a merge in the -rt branches, and preferred
the -rt implementation of the files in question. I used your patches
that are out for review and confirmed that qemux86-64-preempt_rt builds with
the updated kernel.

I built all the -stable boards, and everything looks sane, so this
one should be good to go.

Cheers,

Bruce

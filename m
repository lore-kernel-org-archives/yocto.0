Definitely. Not bisectable, but I wanted to keep the changes logically
separated,
since it allowed a commit message that wasn't too long to read and
be useful. Since there are several recipe categories, boards and layers
involved, I made the choice to split things up.

I typically insist on bisectable series as well, but have made exceptions :=
)

I'm happy to squash things though, if Richard wants them squashed
I'll resend .. or it might be quicker to rebase and squash on merge,
either works for me.

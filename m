Hello everyone, this is my first mail here, I hope this is the right "chann=
el" for my question.

I am currently using the 'Kirkstone' branch of yocto and I have encountered=
 a problem. I have written a .bbappend file for *systemd* in my own layer. =
Here I have written my own python function as follows:

python do_my_own_function(){
# do something
}
addtask my_own_function before do_install

This seems to work most of the time. However, I would like to execute my ow=
n function *AFTER* the do_install. However, this does not seem to work.
If I delete the build folder before building the image and then look in the=
 *log.task_order* file I see that my own function is NOT executed. Other pe=
ople on stackoverflow ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76234388/bitbak=
e-addtask-deploy-after-do-install-not-working-from-image-recipe ) seem to h=
ave observed this problem as well.

So I wanted to ask how to solve the problem or debug it further?

Regards

It can be summarised a bit more succinctly i.e.:

distro: ['distro/poky', 'distro/poky-altcfg', 'distro/poky-tiny']
machine: ['machine/qemux86-64', 'machine/qemuarm64', 'machine/qemuriscv64']

which is why I'm thinking we should perhaps work with this in terms of
fragments/config selection.

No, I mean something different.

In order to speed up builds and reduce network usage, the autobuilder
has a cache of commonly used git repos such as poky, bitbake and some
other metadata layers. When cloning, it will first use those cached
repos, then just do a final pull from upstream, just to ensure
everything is up to date.

Those cache directories are updated by a cron job. I'd like a way of
telling bitbake-setup to use such a cache to speed up checkouts and
reduce network usage.

This feature doesn't need to be that user visible, just available for
the CI setups to configure. The code for this is in yocto-autobuilder-
helper.

I'm not convinced anyone will ever really want to configure "all", it
isn't what users generally want to do.

I suspect what we need is a single base default configuration and a
prompt saying "run XXX" to configure fragments X or Y.

We then allow init to take a list of fragments to configure? That would
mean:

bitbake-setup init poky "machine/qemux86-64 distro/poky-tiny"

would work and we have a way to add new things to the commandline
relatively easily.

Currently the autobuilder dumps the local.conf settings in one of the
steps and it is quite clear about which commands it runs, if you know
where to look. I agree it would be nice to simplify that and go a step
or two further and make it clearer.

Keep in mind that many of the builder targets are series of commands,
not just a single command.

Cheers,

Richard

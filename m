Hi Denys,

No, I got caught up in something else ... I'll try it tomorrow and report
back after I cherry pick that commit Bruce mentioned.

Brian

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is plausible. But in theory, linux-dummy shoul=

=C2=A0 I just updated<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;We still have a race condition in the 1.8 branch for the =

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;If modules start building, they&#39;ll race against the p=

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi Bruce,<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I did some searches and looks like there are a number of &#39=

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>

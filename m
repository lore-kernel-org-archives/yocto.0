i suspect you opened a OE bug, since I can't find it in yocto BZ, however
bugs.openembedded.org doesn't seem to answer at the moment..

so, I checked our configure.ac , and clearly, that needs some love...

Rob: any chance you can look into that? it's the xf86-video-omap
configure.ac file that's wrong, we should mimic what's in the
xf-video-intel one i guess..  otherwise i can try later this week.

Excellent! I'm currently looking at util-linux.

I think we should ask for a new repo to be setup on
git.yoctoproject.org for meta-musl. I'm happy to be one of the
maintainers for that, I hope that you are as well and maybe a couple
of the others who were interested could also help. I think having a
few people as maintainers is important as we're all already fairly
busy on other projects.

Once the layer is setup we can move the recipes off your branch of
oe-core and into the layer as time permits. That would just leave the
changes which need to go into oe-core on your branch.

Does that sound like a sensible plan?

(Adding yocto@yoctoproject.org to CC since that is where meta-selinux patches 
tend to go at least)

To be clear, poky and OE-Core are in lock-step. No patch to core recipes goes 
into Poky directly, they are applied to OE-Core and then they flow into Poky 
immediately thereafter (Richard, who does the merging of patches into OE-Core, 
does the sync to Poky immediately afterwards.)

What's more likely happening I suspect is that you are on a newer 
branch/revision of OE-Core/Poky than the meta-selinux maintainers have tested. 
I can't speak to the maintenance schedule for meta-selinux but maybe others 
with knowledge there can chime in.

We have to draw the line somewhere for what to include in OE-Core, and at the 
moment I guess we have considered SELinux to be outside its scope. Obviously 
these things get re-evaluated from time to time, and SELinux is a little bit 
painful for this because of how many recipes it has to touch. Ultimately it 
depends on how many people in the embedded space want to enable and use 
SELinux.

Thoughts from others?

when tried to build image using command bitbake -k wac-core-image below err=
or poped up.
ERROR: =C2=A0OE-core's config sanity checker detected a potential misconfig=
uration.
Either fix the cause of this error or at your own risk disable the checker =
(see sanity.conf).
Following is the list of potential problems / advisories:
TUNE_ARCH is unset. Please ensure your MACHINE configuration includes a val=
id tune configuration file which will set this correctly.
Error, the PACKAGE_ARCHS variable (all any noarch ${PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS:tun=
e-${DEFAULTTUNE}} wacin) for DEFAULTTUNE (None) does not contain TUNE_PKGAR=
CH ().Toolchain tunings invalid:
No tuning found for default multilib.
I am upgrading from dunfell to scarthgap-5.0.5 (LTS), were dunfell had no T=
UNE_ARCH (tune-coretexA72.inc) but scarthgap has it.
or is it a good practice to disable the checker? Location for tune-coretexA=
72.inc should be /conf/machine/ ?

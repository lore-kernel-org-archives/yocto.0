The most extreme situation is probably bitbake --setscene-only with an
empty TMPDIR. Each of the setscene tasks establishes a new connection.
A server receives so many connections that it treats them as a denial
of service attack by throttling. A separate script would allow the same
connection to be reused to download all the required artifacts.
Limiting the number of threads does not really solve the issue because
there are still the same amount of connections which get quickly
opened.

Yes, we are evaluating sftp. You are right, it is not optimal from a
performance point of view. For example S3 is much faster. A compromise
is to set up a limited number of parallel sftp connections. This has
worked very well so far.

The question of why we use sftp brings us to a larger topic that is
probably relevant for almost all Yocto users, but not for the Yocto
project itself: Security.

There is usually a git server infrastructure that makes it possible to
protect Git repositories with finely graded access policies. As the
sstate-cache contains the same source code, the protection concept for
the Git repositories must also be applied to the sstate-cache
artifacts.

First of all a user authentication is required for the sstate-mirror.
An obvious idea is to use the same user authentication for the sstate-
cache server as for the Git server. In addition to https, ssh is also
often used for git repositories. SSH even offers some advantages in
terms of user-friendliness and security (if a ssh agent is used).=C2=A0This
consideration finally leads us to use the sftp protocol for the sstate
mirror. This is also relatively easy to administer: Simply copy the
user's public ssh keys from the git server to the sftp server.

If one then wants to scale an sstate-cache server for many different
projects and users, one quickly wishes for an option for authorization
at artifact level. Ideally, the access rights to the source code would
be completely transferred to the associated sstate artifacts. For such
an authorization the ssate mirror server would require the SRC_URI
which was used to compile the sstate artifact. With this information,
it could ask the Git server whether or not a user has access to all
source code repositories to grant or deny access to a particular sstate
artifact. It should not be forgotten that the access rights to the Git
repositories can change.

>=20
Yes, that sound very interesting. There are probably even more such
kind of meta data which could be provided by the hashserver to improve
the management of a shared sstate mirror.

Would it make sense to include e.g. the SRC_URI in the hashserv
database and extend the hashserver's API to also provide meta data e.g.
for the authorization of the sstate-mirror? Or is security and
authorization something which should be handled independently from hash
equivalence?

Another topic where additional meta data about the sstate-cache seams
to be beneficial is sstate-mirror retention. Knowing which artifact was
compiled for which tag or commit of the bitbake layer could help to
wipe out some artifacts which are not needed anymore.

It would probably be better to query a harserver if an artifact is

Yes, I also started thinking about the possibilities we would get for
the SDK if there is a hash-server or an even more generic a meta data
server for the sstate-cache in the middle of the infrastructure
picture. it would probably solve some challenges which I could not find
a solution so far.

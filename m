Thanks for driving this Marta. Internally and externally, it feels like 
we're just on the cusp of everyone *suddenly caring* about our security 
response strategy. So it's good to see that we're making moves in that 
direction.

In general, this list looks complete to me. I'm primarily interested in 
the response coordination, triage, and tracking usecases. Those are the 
biggest pain points for my team, at the moment. And that is primarily 
driven by a lack of tooling.

More responses inline.

I'm not sure I understand this usecase. Is there a reason those people 
can't/won't just lookup the CVE on the NIST site?

Has there been any discussion of adopting the OpenVEX document standard 
that the Chainguard guys are putting together? [1] It seems like the VEX 
use-cases align well with our needs around tracking and coordinating CVE 
response between YP member and individual developers.

I've been considering it for my internal use for a while. And also 
considering replacing the existing cve_check output JSON with OpenVEX, 
once it has stabilized.

I'll note here that some of us are sinners and do actually support 
network-attached (and internet-attached) embedded devices. :)

But the greater point of OS vendors being able to triage and assign 
vendor-specific severities to incoming issues is absolutely important to 
my use-cases.

Is there a common nexus for this work? eg. do most of the folks who are 
doing security work tend to congregate on the security sublist?

Very important.

Can you expand on what you mean here? Is this usecase about extending 
the existing tooling into the generic CI processes that YP members are 
using, or about expanding the tooling in the YP's indigenous CI?

I think I passed over the wiki pages and presentations for SRTool once, 
a while ago. But I didn't pay much attention at the time because it 
wasn't clear *what it did*.

After reviewing it again, I think it might be the kind of tooling I've 
been searching for to help my team coordinate our CVE response work. 
I'll test it out and see if it is something I can use/contribute towards.

I'm also interested in this, as the maintainer of our opkg fork. So far, 
I haven't had to respond to a CVE against the project, but that won't 
last forever.

I'm currently doing a related activity - going through oe-core recipes 
in alphabetical order, and making sure that upstream version information 
for them is correct.

I've found a few cases where the upstream check is performed on a stale 
directory (so the recipe is reported 'up to date' even though it's not), 
or the reported upstream version is totally bogus [1], or the upstream 
version is 'unknown' even though it can be retrieved with a correct 
entry in package_regex.inc. Expect patches to come this way soon.

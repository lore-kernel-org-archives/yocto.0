I've always had latent support for mipsel in the kernel tree, since it is
just a minor switch to the configs for the mti.

We'd also sent the KMACHINE to mti-malta32-le to pickup the le
configuration switches from the kernel .. or alternatively, I'll just updat=
e
the description to match on qemumipsel.

I'd want to do some build and boot testing myself first though, Phil seemed
to indicate that patch a) wasn't required. I'll start my own build and see =
if
my results match.

So if there's a desire to get this into oe-core, I can take care of the ker=
nel
tweaks (and then carry it), but I'd expect Richard has an opinion on this, =
since
it really should be something that we then build and minimally test
on a regular basis.

Cheers,

Bruce

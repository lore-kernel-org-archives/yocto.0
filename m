This adds openjdk-8 for native and target builds and allows a stripped
OpenJRE-8 being built as well instead of trying to cherry-pick jre
components from jdk-image.

+The GNU General Public License (GPL)
+
+Version 2, June 1991
+
+Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
+
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this =
license
+document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+Preamble
+
+The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom =
to share
+and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended =
to
+guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure =
the
+software is free for all its users.  This General Public License =
applies to
+most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other =
program whose
+authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation =
software is
+covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can =
apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. =
 Our
+General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the =
freedom to
+distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you =
wish),
+that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can =
change
+the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you =
know you
+can do these things.
+
+To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone =
to deny
+you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These =
restrictions
+translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies =
of the
+software, or if you modify it.
+
+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis =
or for
+a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You =
must
+make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you =
must
+show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and =
(2)
+offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, =
distribute
+and/or modify the software.
+
+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain =
that
+everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  =
If the
+software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its =
recipients to
+know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems =
introduced
+by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
+
+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. =
 We
+wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
+individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program =
proprietary.
+To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed =
for
+everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and =
modification
+follow.
+
+TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a =
notice
+placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the =
terms of
+this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such =
program
+or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or =
any
+derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing =
the
+Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications =
and/or
+translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is =
included
+without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is =
addressed as
+"you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not =
covered by
+this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the =
Program is
+not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its =
contents
+constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made =
by
+running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program =
does.
+
+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source =
code as
+you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
+disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this =
License
+and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of =
the
+Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and =
you may
+at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of =
it, thus
+forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such =
modifications
+or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet =
all of
+these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices =
stating
+    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in =
whole or
+    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part =
thereof, to be
+    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the =
terms of
+    this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively =
when run,
+    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in =
the
+    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
+    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty =
(or
+    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may =
redistribute
+    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to =
view a copy
+    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive =
but does
+    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the =
Program is
+    not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If =
identifiable
+sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be =
reasonably
+considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this =
License, and
+its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as =
separate
+works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole =
which is a
+work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the =
terms
+of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the =
entire
+whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest =
your
+rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to =
exercise the
+right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works =
based on
+the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program =
with the
+Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage =
or
+distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of =
this
+License.
+
+3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, =
under
+Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of =
Sections 1 and
+2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable =
source
+    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 =
above
+    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three =
years, to
+    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of =
physically
+    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of =
the
+    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of =
Sections 1
+    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; =
or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer =
to
+    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed =
only
+    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program =
in
+    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
+    Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for =
making
+modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code =
means all
+the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated =
interface
+definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and =
installation
+of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
+distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in =
either
+source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and =
so on)
+of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that =
component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access =
to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the =
source
+code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, =
even though
+third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the =
object code.
+
+4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program =
except as
+expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, =
modify,
+sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically =
terminate
+your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received =
copies, or
+rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses =
terminated so
+long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not =
signed it.
+However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the =
Program
+or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do =
not
+accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the =
Program (or
+any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this =
License to
+do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or =
modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the =
Program),
+the recipient automatically receives a license from the original =
licensor to
+copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and =
conditions.
+You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise =
of the
+rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing =
compliance by
+third parties to this License.
+
+7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), =
conditions
+are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) =
that
+contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from =
the
+conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other =
pertinent
+obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program =
at all.
+For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free =
redistribution
+of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly =
through
+you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would =
be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under =
any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to =
apply and
+the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any =
patents or
+other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; =
this
+section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free =
software
+distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  =
Many
+people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
+distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application =
of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing =
to
+distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot =
impose that
+choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to =
be a
+consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in =
certain
+countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
+copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an =
explicit
+geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
+distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. =
 In
+such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in =
the body
+of this License.
+
+9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions =
of the
+General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be =
similar in
+spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new =
problems
+or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any =
later
+version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions =
either of
+that version or of any later version published by the Free Software =
Foundation.
+If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you =
may
+choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
+
+10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free =
programs
+whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask =
for
+permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software =
Foundation,
+write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for =
this.
+Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free =
status of
+all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and =
reuse of
+software generally.
+
+NO WARRANTY
+
+11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO =
WARRANTY FOR
+THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN =
OTHERWISE
+STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE =
THE
+PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR =
IMPLIED,
+INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF =
MERCHANTABILITY AND
+FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY =
AND
+PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE =
DEFECTIVE,
+YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN =
WRITING WILL
+ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR =
REDISTRIBUTE THE
+PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
+GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF =
THE USE OR
+INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA =
OR DATA
+BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES =
OR A
+FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF =
SUCH HOLDER
+OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest =
possible
+use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free =
software
+which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to =
attach
+them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the =
exclusion
+of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line =
and a
+pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it =
does.
+
+    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or =
modify it

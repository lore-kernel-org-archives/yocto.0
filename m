Apologies for the massive cross-post, but most users don't read the =
development lists :) To avoid 'reply all' mistakes the addressed lists =
are in BCC. In case you are wondering which lists: the beagleboard list, =
the meta-ti list and the yocto project list.

A minor update to the below: the test server will be down for a short =
time wednesday to upgrade the RAM.

> Hi,
>=20
> With the change to an oe-core based system a lot of things changed and =
angstrom itself has gone through some changes as well. One of those =
changes is that some packages were renamed or deprecated.=20
> To keep narcissus working the decision was made to remove all machines =
and trim the package lists.
>=20
> The new machine list matches the autobuilder: qemuarm, qemumips, =
qemuppc, qemux86, beagleboard and beagleboard. That matches the machines =
supported in OE-core and the ones I get paid to support for my day job.
>=20
> The branch: =
https://github.com/Angstrom-distribution/narcissus/commits/core-update
> Test setup: http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/narcissus/
>=20
> The process to add machines is fairly simple:
>=20
> 1) Find the layer for the machine in =
http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/LayerIndex
> 2) Check the setup scripts to see if it's already configured
> 3) Send patch for setupscripts
> 4) Send patch for narcissus
>=20
> The process for packages is pretty much the same. The will need review =
since not every layer plays nice with others. I'm hoping that this =
process will be easy enough for people to follow while preventing =
non-working combinations to get added.

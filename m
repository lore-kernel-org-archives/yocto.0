In preparation for some larger kernel changes being sent 
for review, I'm clearing my queue of a few minor changes
that were done while working on the 0.9 release.

The uImage one is particularly interesting, since it was
a fix for the default beagle board uImage being completely
unbootable. 

The force revisions is largely cosmetic, but it is used
by my upcoming kernel dev layer and I think it is more in
the spirit of other variables that are set from local
configurations.

The following changes since commit e417aa98e4b4170f4b4aaf805cc8ea20f8593604:
  Bruce Ashfield (1):
        wrs_meta: add USB options for wacom tablet support

are available in the git repository at:

  ssh://git@git.pokylinux.org/poky-contrib zedd/kernel-fixes

Bruce Ashfield (2):
      linux-wrs: rename force_revisions and allow override
      kernel: prefer the kernel produced uImage

For reporting an issue and discussing it, I don't disagree that something c=
an
happen on the mailing list.

But if the reporter wants serious time spent on a bug (or I should say that=
 the
fix for the bug is something that will take more than a few minutes),
I think it is
reasonable to expect that the reporter (not the person working on the bug) =
takes
the responsibility to get it into the bug tracker.

Assigning and scoping the actual work doesn't scale based on email threads
(as someone who has been thrashing to keep information straight, and reprod=
uce
issues .. I feel this pain greatly).

Just my frozen 2 canadian cents! :)

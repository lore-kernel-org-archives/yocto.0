There were only a few changes needed between dunfell and gatesgarth to keep
it building and I feel guilty for sending half of them - and pinging you on
FB :).

I don't have interest in python2, but it's still used by quite a few
components included in other layers are care about (e.g. qtwebengine in
meta-qt5, chromium in meta-browser -
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=942720 is still quite
far from finished) and at LGE we maintain meta-ros
https://github.com/ros/meta-ros which contains support for ROS 1 Melodic
which is usually used with python2 and support ends May 2023 (together with
Ubuntu Bionic it's usually used with: http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions -
just today I've separated meta-ros-python2 layer with python2 recipes which
disappeared from oe-core in warrior and were never re-introduced in
meta-python2 (like nose and numpy).

If you're looking for someone just keeping it buildable, then you can sign
me up. If it gets more annoying to maintain in future we can also split it
for pythonnative.bbclass and python recipe itself - to keep just the bare
minimum of recipes which are actively being used without all the other junk.

Cheers,

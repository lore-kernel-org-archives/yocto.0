alsa is the defacto / first choice for me.

That's partially why I chose to make this an
optional config block for this feature. That way
it is optional, and only applied to the specific qemu
images that we decided to add it for. All other kernels
and BSPs are unaffected.

If/when we get ALSA working for these qemu based machines,
we can easily drop this. But it looks like the only avenue
for the sound support immediately, so we slide it in
in as shallow a manner as possible.

Any and all patches to convert back to ALSA will be
happily merged! :)

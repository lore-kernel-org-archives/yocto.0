i have forwarded this email to the relevant people in Linaro working on
LAVA. I hope to be able to bring more information about that, as I am not
involved with LAVA, just a 'user' of it. By 'root' here, you mean on the
server side, e.g. the LAVA instance, which will typically not be the
'builder', or do you want to couple build and test on the same 'server'?
LAVA jobs are generally submitted by a CI instance (Jenkins in our case).

that is no longer the case. we do have support for 'native' OE images, and
we've had that for a while. That is what I am using for my project at
Linaro. None of our projects/jobs deliverable are 'public' at the moment,
so you won't find them, but i can confirm that what we deploy for our jobs
is the output of OE (e.g. what is in the deploy/image folder). hwpack was
something mostly meant to make it simpler to work with Ubuntu and Android
root FS, and is not suited for OE.

I agree that this is a problem and we should fix. Our IT infrastructure is
largely based on Ubuntu servers, but that should not affect what we create
that much.

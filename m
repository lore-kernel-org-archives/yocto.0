Update.  Not sure if I did this right but this is what I did.  I added
master as a remote and cherry picked
02d0a003d603266114512160b209876199241e98.  Next I just went for it and
tried to bitbake my image again and got the same result as before.
Next I did a bitbake cleanall on virtual/kernel and tried to make my
image again and still got the same result.

I'm going to leave this build as is and setup a new one using 1.8
master and see if I get the same thing again.  I'll leave this broken
build alone for a while in case someone wants me to try something with
it to fix it.

Regards,

Brian

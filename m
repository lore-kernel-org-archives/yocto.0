I've never seen that wiki page before (or at least I don't remember
seeing it), so I can't confirm or deny the validity of the content :)

If systemd is breaking your build, make sure to log a bugzilla against

What release branch are you using ?

I'm running docker from meta-virt every day, as are many others,
but you have several differences in your configuration.

  - most use systemd as the init manager, I know that I do. That
    is going to impact how cgroups is set up on your 'host' image.
    You shouldn't need to touch cgroups at all if systemd is used,
    since it is correct out of the box.

  - You are using a different kernel and kernel configuration.
    linux-yocto + the configuration fragments in the layer are what
    is routinely tested. Are you using linux-yocto, or something
    different ? If it is different, all you can do is run the various
    checks to make sure that the docker prereqs are in place.

    The errors you see in dockerd tells me that the options you are
    turning on, are not making it into the final kernel that is
    running on target.

Cheers,

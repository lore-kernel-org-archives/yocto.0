it has been under my radar for a while. I have actually locally made
toolchains with
clang+musl and it seems to be coming along. its licensed differently thats
the biggest attraction for folks who do static linking. Otherwise it still
doesnt yet support variety of architectures that other libcs support. given
now we have kconfig for eglibc too may be it fills in the nommu gap much
like uclibc does today. I have some plans for 1.7 for adding it to OE
may be in a layer
of its own first and then migrate it to OE-core

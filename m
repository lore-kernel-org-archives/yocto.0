Mailing lists are great for discussion (e.g. "I have this problem but I=
'm not=20
sure of the right way to solve it") but a terrible way to track actual =
bugs,=20
because mailing lists tend to concentrate on the latest postings; older=
 issues=20
that haven't been resolved rapidly disappear with the tide of new posti=
ngs. Of=20
course old issues can build up in a bug tracker, but at least it's triv=
ially=20
easy to find open issues where it's much more difficult to find unresol=
ved issues=20
on a mailing list.

The point is, the best way to ensure that an issue gets solved at least=
 for=20
OE-Core is to file a bug in the YP bugzilla. There is then a triage pro=
cess and=20
in most cases someone to actually assign the issue to so that it can be=
 dealt=20
with. There is no such process on the mailing lists.

Hi Everyone!

Armin Kuster of Monta Vista  will be the stable maintainer for the Dizzy 
branch, and it is now open for suggestions of backport patches.

The following wiki page has the Policies and process for requesting a 
fix in a stable branch, please review that before sending a patch.

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Stable_branch_maintenance

Please remember to include [dizzy] in any request (backport or commit).

We do not have a hard date for this yet, but likely be early in the New 
Year time frame for the 1.7.1 release.

Thanks to all for your efforts.

     Sau!

Saul Wold
Yocto Component Wrangler @ Intel
Yocto Project / Poky Build System

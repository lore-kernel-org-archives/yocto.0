Excellent Questions!



Dogfooding =E2=80=93 Good point.  The
https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D9502 bug is intended to
address that. With this, we can build and test container images just as we
can do with the Build Appliance. As an added win, those folks building
Busybox based minimal sized containers would have a different way to do
that...



OS availability: Docker is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Were
there fears about specific Linux distributions?



It does not seem to be too much harder to try Docker on Windows than it was
to try Virtualbox.  That being said, Docker is moving/changing more quickly
so it may have more bumps in the road but more features too=E2=80=A6



Windows explained more in depth or one of those bumps=E2=80=A6:

  The answer is a little complicated, so please bear with me.  There are 2
different versions of Docker for Windows.  The original version is known as
=E2=80=9CDocker Toolbox=E2=80=9D https://www.docker.com/products/docker-too=
lbox.  This is
basically Docker running in a minimal VirtualBox Linux VM.  They made a
separate host binary called docker-machine to help manage the images. This
is, in my opinion, a little clunky and does add some complexity when
switching from Docker running on Linux to Docker Toolbox running on
Windows. The clunkiness is largely due to the VirtualBox VM being =E2=80=9C=
between=E2=80=9D
the host and the Docker Engine. This version is targeted to people whose
Windows version does not meet the requirements specified below.



  If you have 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education (1511 November
update, Build 10586 or later) and Microsoft Hyper-V, then you can download
=E2=80=9CDocker for Windows=E2=80=9D https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-win=
dows/.  This is
a Docker implementation for Windows that relies on Hyper-V and a much
smaller vm.  It is also better integrated into the host environment so that
the discontinuity between the host side and the Docker  Engine is no longer
as jarring.  For example, you get a disk tray icon for Docker, can set up
http proxies for it, can manage how much memory and how many cpus it will
get=E2=80=A6


This (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/) is nice page
that addresses the difference between the newer hypervisor approach and the
older "Docker Toolbox aka VirtualBox" approach.  The page is discussing it
from a Mac perspective but if you replace xhyve with Windows 10 Hyper-V,
the page is relevant to Windows as well.



The Mac implementation is functionally equivalent to =E2=80=9CDocker for Wi=
ndows=E2=80=9D
and is called =E2=80=9CDocker for Mac=E2=80=9D
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/.  It runs on a modified
xhyve hypervisor.



The Linux implementation runs as a container and uses the same kernel as
the host.



Thanks for the feedback and if I missed or shortchanged something please
let me know,

-Brian

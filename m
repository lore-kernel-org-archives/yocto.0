 From the logs, I can see that bitbake is trying (among others):
downloads.yoctoproject.org
sources.openembedded.org

but hits a 404, so it fall-backs to GCC's SVN repo directly.

On the side, from the bitbake logs, I end up with a rather obscure error:
svn: E175002: REPORT of '/svn/gcc/!svn/vcc/default': 200 OK 
(http://gcc.gnu.org)

When trying a checkout manually from the outside machine, it fails too, 
but the error message is a bit more friendly:
svn: REPORT of '/svn/gcc/!svn/vcc/default': Could not read response 
body: connection was closed by server (http://gcc.gnu.org)

I found plenty of "black magic" workarounds on the web while looking for 
the strange "Error: [...] 200 OK", among them was to increase Apache 
time out! Which won't even really solve my problem, because the checkout 
will takes hours, if not days!

Right now, I'm really stuck. The only solutions I can think of are:
- Ask kindly Arago not to use GCC code from SVN, or maybe to upload an 
archive on yocto/oe mirrors.
- Check with GNU/GCC guys if they can do something about it (maybe it's 
a temporary issue with their server)
- Wait and see, cross my fingers. :(

Thanks,
Chris

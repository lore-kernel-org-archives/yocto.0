I'm in CEST (Central European zone). If we aim for the 3rd then let's stay
for late afternoon for me.

I let Ross, Randy and everyone else interested to express their preferences=

<br>
Hi David,<br>
Thank you very much for the description and the offer to get a demo.<br>
As discussed yesterday in the call, there are some other people who<br>
seem interested.<br>
<br>
&gt; PROPOSAL 1: If the full triage is too much to bite off to start with, =
perhaps using it to track and coordinate work will bring immediate benefit.=
<br>
<br>
This is the reason I want to test how much time it takes.<br>
<br>
&gt; PROPOSAL 2: I am happy to give you a live demo of Wind River&#39;s ful=
ly operational SRTool, so you can see all of the bells and whistles in acti=
on. I am available pretty much anytime between 10:00 am Pacific to 2:00 am =
Pacific.<br>
<br>
That would be nice. What about 11am Pacific on tomorrow (28 Sept or<br>
Oct 3)? I think that you have meant 10am to 2PM, otherwise 1am Pacific<br>
would work very well for me too :P<br>
<br>
&gt; PROPOSAL 3: I will start refreshing the YP SRTool repository with my c=
urrent implementation level from Wind River (with the Wind River specific m=
odules left out of course :-)<br>
<br>
That would be great. I&#39;m going to add the missing file for the test<br>
next week, the tool needs a script to download 2023 data.<br>
<br>

&gt; Hi Marta,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * SRTool: We might decide to use it again. It allows one to do much bu=
t requires constant commitment.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; There are many ways to use the SRTool.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(a)=C2=A0 The original design was to perform 100% triage o=
f incoming CVEs. This was a business requirement of Wind River, and we have=
 used the SRTool successfully for 4-5 year now.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(b)=C2=A0 The main limitation with the SRTool for Yocto Pr=
oject was the lack of integration with Bugzilla (Ross ran out of time)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * This is the crucial other half of the workflow<b=
r>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * There is the automatic creation of appropriate d=
efect records for investigation<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * There is also the automatic tracking of the over=
all CVE status, both CVEs in progress and the CVEs completed<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * Wind River has an extension for full integration=
 with Jira, and that saves weeks of work for the CVE management<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(c) The guiding rule was that CVE management was in the SR=
Tool, but specific defect work was also done in Jira/Bugzilla, for a clean =
separate of domains<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(d)=C2=A0 The SRTool has a user model<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * Together with Bugzilla, it is easy to track sing=
le people and even multiple people working on CVEs<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(e) The SRTool also has the built-on ability to look up th=
e CVE status from other distributions (Red Hat, Debian, ...) so that one ca=
n get a peek of existing triages and resolutions<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(f) The SRTool is build like Toaster on top of Django, so =
development and debugging skills for Toaster immediate apply<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(g) Also with the Django base, it is very simple to add an=
y number of modular extensions to support for example CVE Scanner integrati=
on<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(h) The SRTool also has report generation (in text, CSV, a=
nd Excel) in addition to email notification support.<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0(i) There is also a &quot;private&quot; model for CVEs und=
er embargo, with strict access control lists.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; PROPOSAL 1: If the full triage is too much to bite off to start with, =
perhaps using it to track and coordinate work will bring immediate benefit.=
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; PROPOSAL 2: I am happy to give you a live demo of Wind River&#39;s ful=
ly operational SRTool, so you can see all of the bells and whistles in acti=
on. I am available pretty much anytime between 10:00 am Pacific to 2:00 am =
Pacific.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; PROPOSAL 3: I will start refreshing the YP SRTool repository with my c=
urrent implementation level from Wind River (with the Wind River specific m=
odules left out of course :-)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; David<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; BTW, I also support an extension to the SRTool that manages CVE scanni=
ng of build images, with hooks to a=C2=A0 number existing CVE scanners (e.g=
. Trivy) in addition to other vulnerability metrics. This is probably out o=
f scope to YP at this time, but it is perhaps something to grow in to.<br>

&gt; Subject: [yocto] Security processes: YP needs<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Hello,<br>
&gt; I&#39;ve been working recently on collecting what works and what doesn=
&#39;t<br>
&gt; in YP security processes. The goal is to go forward and define an<br>
&gt; actionable strategy!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Today, I&#39;d like to share with you the summary of what I have heard=
 as<br>
&gt; needs from several people (those in Cc:).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I want the community to comment and tell us what you find important<br=
>
&gt; and what you&#39;d like to see added or changed from this list.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * CVEs: Visibility if YP is vulnerable or not<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; People want to be able to check/look up a specific CVE; it might be a<=
br>
&gt; CVE unrelated to YP<br>
&gt; (eg. package not included, Windows issue). The cve-checker result is a=
<br>
&gt; part of the solution, but people also want to know which CVEs do not<b=
r>
&gt; apply.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * CVEs: synchronization of the work on fixes<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Currently, there is no synchronization; multiple parties might be<br>
&gt; working on the same fix while nobody is working on another. There<br>
&gt; might be duplication of work.<br>
&gt; Ross has <a href=3D"https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/CVE_Status" rel=
=3D"noreferrer noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/=
wiki/CVE_Status</a><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Triaging of security issues<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Related to CVE fixes and includes issues reported directly to the YP.<=
br>
&gt; Some issues are more likely to be serious for embedded products<br>
&gt; (attack by network), so not all has the same priority.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Private security communication<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A way to send a notification of a non-public security issue. For<br>
&gt; researchers, other projects etc.<br>
&gt; The security alias exists, but only some people know about its existen=
ce.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Visibility of the security work of the YP<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; There is much work on security in the YP, but it lacks visibility.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Documentation<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Related to visibility. We need easy-to-find documentation of subjects<=
br>
&gt; like submitting a CVE fix,<br>
&gt; reporting a private issue, and how our processes work... This<br>
&gt; documentation should address people who are not regular contributors.<=
br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Additional tooling<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We could add additional tooling: a template on how to add cve-check to=
<br>
&gt; the CI (possibly<br>
&gt; a different one than the autobuilder), analyze the result, and extend<=
br>
&gt; our tooling to their layers...<br>
&gt; It is also related to the &quot;Architecture&quot; topic below.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Architecture work<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Security if more than CVE fixes. We also have what is happening in<br>
&gt; meta-security: hardening, compiler option,<br>
&gt; secure package configuration, use of code coverage tools, and so on<br=
>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * SRTool<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We might decide to use it again. It allows one to do much but requires=
<br>
&gt; constant commitment.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Presence on pre-notification lists and receiving information before<=
br>
&gt; the vulnerability gets public<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; YP currently depends on public data. Principal distributions receive<b=
r>
&gt; the information before<br>
&gt; a vulnerability becomes public. It requires (in short) private<br>
&gt; reporting, a security team, and a track<br>
&gt; of excellent security record.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; * Becoming a CNA (be able to assign CVEs)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Needed if we want to assign CVEs to the software of the YP, like<br>
&gt; autobuilder, Toaster etc.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Kind regards,<br>
&gt; Marta<br>

Thanks for your reviews. Good to know that the "transition" branch is
still in use in spite of what I wrongly believed.
It indeed, it's a good idea to see what other projects are doing. Maybe
what we are doing is unnecessarily complicated.

Look at Python docs (https://docs.python.org/) for example. They have a
switcher as we do, and also a left bar the latest versions and a
separate page for all versions. However, such versions are only shown on
the top page. When you enter one of the documents though for a given
version, the left bar is used for navigation between sections instead,
and you no longer have references to other versions.

Let's keep thinking about this, to find an easier to manage solution.
Thanks again
Michael.

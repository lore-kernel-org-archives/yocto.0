This seems fine to me as an area to hash out good practices and
experiment, as long as we don't expect to use this structure long
term.  It makes sense for the core layers to be in one repo, but it
makes more sense to use one git repository per external layer, imo.
Is that the intent, or am I misunderstanding its purpose?

  jsut one of those things that starts to grate on me after a while
... while reading BSP guide, the text bounces back and forth between
"BSP Layer" and "BSP layer."

  personally, i'm not a huge fan of upper case (quelle surprise!), so
unless it's being used as a proper name, i think "BSP layer" is by far
the preferred style, and i'm happy to tweak the guide as i'm going
through it, unless there are massive objections.

  pretty sure i'm going to find at least a few things to adjust so i
can just fold that in with the rest. thoughts?

  first, i realize PPC is still supported, despite the official
dropping of reference target MPC8315-RDB. also aware of meta-riscv

  https://github.com/riscv

despite not having a reference board.

  is there somewhere to point people when they ask about the state of
the world WRT supported architectures?

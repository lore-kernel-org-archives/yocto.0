The layer index does already support this, it's just not exposed (at the time 
I introduced it - some time ago - I thought it might encourage people to 
deviate from the release branch names, but in hindsight that was probably not 
worth worrying about.) So at the moment an admin can set an alternative branch 
name. It would not be hard to expose it through the UI for layer maintainers 
though.

Cheers,
Paul

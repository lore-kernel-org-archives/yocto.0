I agree. We can run latencytop without sudo. However, it is possible
to install the Eclipse Yocto Plug-in from the downloads.yoctoproject.org.
So, it may not be necessary to build the Eclipse Yocto Plug-in
support in-order to use it.

In that case, when we use the latencytop plugin from Eclipse by
connecting to a target board running linux, it will fail with the
following output:
# sudo : command not found

It is because of this line in 'LatencytopHandler.java':
private static String initCmd="export
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin; cd; sudo latencytop\r"; 

This line 'assumes' that every target board with latencytop also have
sudo. Please correct me if I am wrong.

I didn't mean that :) 
This is a special case for latencytop. Please let me know your comments.

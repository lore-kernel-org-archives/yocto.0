Richard/Saul,

I'll repeat what is in the patch here:

The existing 2.6.34 kernel tree uses _ where poky typically
uses -. This is a historical artifact, since working with
gnu Make and shells means avoiding - is wise. The opposite
is true in Yocto.

To avoid using the _ reserved character wherever possible
we can simply remove it from the branch names in the
new 2.6.37 kernel, but to keep the content stable in the
0.9 2.6.34 kernel, we map _ to - for the purposes of
packaging.

To further faciliate this switch, the branch names no
longer need to be shortened in the KMACHINE mappings, but
can be fully specified and the tools/processing adapt as
required. This gives us the flexibility to map multiple
boards to a single branch for building.

-------

I've been building with this for a week, Darren has also
had sucess with this as well.

*** We need to coordinate the merge, I've pushed the new
    branches to the linux-yocto-2.6.37 kernel, but we need
    to purge the old branches as well. 

    So send me a heads up and I'll do that removal once
    this merges. 

Pull URL: git://git.pokylinux.org/poky-contrib.git
  Branch: zedd/kernel
  Browse: http://git.pokylinux.org/cgit.cgi/poky-contrib/log/?h=zedd/kernel

Thanks,
    Bruce Ashfield <bruce.ashfield@windriver.com>

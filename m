Yes, it's 3.1.9 and it does compile. But the latest commits don't run =
when I build them (system displays a 'failed to execute kernel' error =
screen). Paul Eggleton has failed to get any to work when built using =
4.7.0 (current master), so it does look as if this is compiler-related.

None of the commits appear to be likely to cause a change from 'good' to =
'bad'.

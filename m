So you mean:

 * base package feed
 * meta-qt5 package feed

and in case meta-qt5 adds a bbappend, in a existing recipe, what will
be the behavior?

This part is easy as all package managers we use has support for it (I
think) so it is a matter of proper generating those and add a method
to include it in the image, the first part is the most complicated one

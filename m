Hi Mirela,

I have asked a few people about this, because Hob is pretty much
deprecated at this point (it's being replaced by a web interface called
Toaster). They replied they would be willing to merge changes to Hob, as
long as they can be sure they won't cause any regressions.

I hope this helps.

Cheers

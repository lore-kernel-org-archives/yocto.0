Hi Saul,
Yi is doing testing for beagleboard and I think he would send out test stat=
us today.

Sugarbay graphics testing was introduced during 1.0 M4. At that time, we ha=
d to build mesa-demos by ourselves and copy it into target image. We submit=
ted bugs for it during 1.1 M1 because we think it better to use mesa-demos =
built from autobuilder.
And yes, adding it into sato-sdk is good enough.

Thanks a lot.

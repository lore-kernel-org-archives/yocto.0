Yes, we do. All difficulties we'd found are solved in referred =
initoverlay
recipe. Maybe one fine I write a blog post regarding that topic ;)

How does that fit into an ro rootfs?

> Please tell me more about your experience with overlayfs :)

It's more stable than unionfs. There was little effort updating
systems from 3.10 with overlay patch to 4.1 with overlay builtin
kernel (work dirs must be created - =
https://github.com/rdm-dev/meta-jens/blob/jethro/recipes-core/initoverlay/=
initoverlay/migrate2overlay.sh#L28-L30)

Your advice about BB_DONT_CACHE does cause reparsing to get triggered. I
can see that in logs.

But this part I'm not seeing. The variable's value is always recalculated
(sometimes more than once during a Bitbake run, but that's okay because
it's idempotent), but the task only re-executes if the payload of the .bb
file itself has changed. The blurb I wrote above:

  do_install[vardepsalwaysdirty] = " EXTERNALLY_INFLUENCED_VARIABLE "

is just some nonsense syntax I wrote there to illustrate my point. I don't
think there's any var flag called "vardepsalwaysdirty". Did you have this
line in mind when you were saying that I'd already gotten the task made
dependent on the variable? Or were you just noting that the syntactic use
of the variable inside of the task should engage the normal hash-based
task-dependency calculation logic?

Is there anything extra I need to do to cause the reparsed variable's hash
to cascade to the task?

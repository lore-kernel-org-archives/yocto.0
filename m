I think these differences between SDK and bitbake environment are no
longer required and they have been problematic. I would try to make the
bitbake environment usable like the eSDK environment was without trying
to replicate all the details of the eSDK installer such as these
local.conf settings.

That's not needed it there is a full bitbake environment.

As already mentioned in my previous mail, a locked SDK is not a must if
the full bitbake environment with shared sstate-cache is available.
Locking might be added later as an optional feature.

As already mentioned in my previous mail, the SSTATE_MIRRORS does not
work well. Downloading the sstate-cache to SSTATE_DIR works much
better, at least for us.

The different folder structures of the eSDK and the bitbake environment
cause many issues in the past. We should get rid of that and keep the
layers structure form the bitbake environment. But that's already the
case if the layers are replicated with the bitbake-layers tools from
Alex.

In the eSDK you can do "devtool build" without specifying the image
which should be used. That's probably then taken from this config line.
But also this seams to be pointless in a full bitbake environment.

That's exactly what my devtool ide plugin does if it gets called
without a recipe. See
https://patchwork.yoctoproject.org/project/oe-core/patch/20231101110129.647=
878-9-adrian.freihofer@siemens.com/
and search for *Shared sysroots mode*.

Simply speaking, the new populate_sdk_ext implementation could look
like this:

Create a tar file which contains:
- Output of bitbake-layers create-layers-setup
- Output of bitbake-layers save-build-conf
- An sstate download script which can download the artifacts from a
mirror into SSTATE_DIR.
- Optionally: The populated sstate-cache folder.

Generates a script which:
- includes the tar file as the existing installer
- extracts the tar and runs all the scripts from the tar.

This would allow to initially setup the SDK with an installer. It would
also allow to download a newer installer and install it over and
existing setup. It would basically just checkout different commits of
of the layers and update the sstate-cache. But it would also allow to
update the SDK independently from an installer, by just using git to
change the commits of the layers and re-run the sstate-download script
again. This architecture would also allow to switch for example the
MACHINE or compile another image.

And, please have a look at the devtool ide plugin. It was developed
with all that in mind.

Adrian

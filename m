To be honest I'm not familiar with /usr merge, I need to check on that 
to see if it is a good option with the current OE-core infrastructure.

Thanks for sharing your experience, this is another big con for the 
Overlay option.

I left the /boot partition separate just in case there is need to 
replace the kernel or the bootloader. This way it would be easier to 
change using the same method as the upgrading the rootfs.

I was thinking in the same thinking just backwards, usually 
configuration files are just small text files that don't require too 
much space. If you require a new feature in the target that will make 
rootfs to grow depending on the feature. I plan to use wic to accomplish 
the filesystem structure. A good thing about wic is that it will be very 
easy to do the swap, just need to modify two options in the .wks file.

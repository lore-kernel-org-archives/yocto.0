I should have qualified well known as well known to anyone that has debugged
latency spikes with USB and flash in the past.

I've been integrating and working with -rt since 2.6.10, so we've run
into latency issues with flash and usb over the years. You'll also
find references to it on the rt-users mailing list.

It's the locking, timeouts and the software layering that are part of
usb and flash filesystems that cause the problems. Changing the
interrupts to all be threaded, and/or use RCU is challenging and I've
never seen a full conversion. That being said, newer kernels are
definitely better on this front than the older ones.

The rootfs being on flash would be ok, as long as frequent writes
weren't happening, or if they were happening, from a sufficiently
low priority thread.

On that thought, have you looked at the processes running on your
system ? Are there any high priority tasks that might be starving
the handling of your interrupts ?

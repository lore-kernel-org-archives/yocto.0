I guess some people or companies somehow felt entitled to Tim doing
continuing python2 layer support for them in a particularly annoying way,
and this was a reality check for them.
We are all volunteers and we owe nothing to anyone. If you don=E2=80=99t l=
ike this
proposition, get a commercial support contract or hire more people to do
the work you want to be done.

Well, it has never been the case... We had deploy_linaro_image to
deploy images since day 1, supporting hwpack + rootfs image or
pre-built image.
Support for 'native' OE images as you call it, fall into the pre-built
image method.
It has some assumption since we use our own baked images, but I'm
pretty sure we can fix it if more people are using it for OE testing.

Some other deployment methods have been added like
deploy_linaro_kernel, for network boot:

It isn't suited for OE is a personal opinion. As a matter of fact,
there's use cases where we need only the rootfs and don't want to
rebuild everything just to change the kernel.

There's a work in progress on LAVA deployment. It has been
re-organized to make it easier to package for distributions. LAVA does
work on Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora and packages will be available for those
distro.

afaict, the non-root requirement is the blocker.
The other issues reported will be resolved as part of our roadmap.

I did a quick 'bitbake -k core-image-minimal' to see what's currently
failing. Full logs and config at
http://www.paulbarker.me.uk/musl-build/

Build Configuration:
BB_VERSION        = "1.21.1"
BUILD_SYS         = "x86_64-linux"
NATIVELSBSTRING   = "Ubuntu-12.04"
TARGET_SYS        = "arm-oe-linux-musleabi"
MACHINE           = "qemuarm"
DISTRO            = "nodistro"
DISTRO_VERSION    = "nodistro.0"
TUNE_FEATURES     = "armv5 thumb dsp"
TARGET_FPU        = "soft"
meta              = "kraj/musl:faafa7022ed057d55c131c456d1bdd5dfa3d2517"

Summary: 6 tasks failed:
  openembedded-core/meta/recipes-support/attr/attr_2.4.47.bb, do_compile
  openembedded-core/meta/recipes-devtools/python/python_2.7.3.bb, do_compile

  openembedded-core/meta/recipes-core/glib-2.0/glib-2.0_2.38.2.bb, do_compile

I can see for util-linux that we need to implement qsort_r().

Busybox probably just needs config changes:
http://wiki.musl-libc.org/wiki/Building_Busybox

glib is getting confused as both musl and libiconv provide <iconv.h> as warned:

    WARNING: The recipe libiconv is trying to install files into a shared area
    when those files already exist. Those files and their manifest location are:
       /home/pbarker/musl-build/build/tmp-musl/sysroots/qemuarm/usr/include/iconv.h
       Matched in manifest-qemuarm-musl.populate_sysroot
    Please verify which package should provide the above files.

We also have:

    WARNING: The recipe gettext is trying to install files into a shared area
    when those files already exist. Those files and their manifest location are:

    Please verify which package should provide the above files.

    WARNING: QA Issue: gettext: Files/directories were installed but not shipped
      /usr/lib/charset.alias

Hope this helps,

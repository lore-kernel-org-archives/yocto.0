Y2038 ptests maybe?

Here is the list of integrated tests to ptests:

Could you be more specific here? Would you like to disable some
syscalls?

Could you be more specific here? The glibc now supports the whole set
of syscalls as of 2.34 version?

To enable them one needs to pass -D_TIME_BITS=3D64 flag when compiling
programs.

This is now the official glibc ABI.

Ok.

The binary shall work without issues on glibc 2.34+ and 5.10+ kernel
without issues.

The only problem happens when new binaries with 64 bit time support are
run on glibc or kernel not supporting 64 bit time.=20

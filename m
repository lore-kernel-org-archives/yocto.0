  for wholly-unrelated reasons, i fell across devicetree.bbclass and
was inspired to check what inherited it, and noticed that nothing in
oe-core or meta-openembedded inherited it ... i had to dig around
through all the layers on my system until i found it inherited from
meta-xilinx, and nowhere else.

  in any event, there is no mention of that class file in the YP
reference manual in the classes section ... should there be?

p.s. i noticed there is also a kernel-devicetree.bbclass file -- i'm
going through both of them now to understand what they do.

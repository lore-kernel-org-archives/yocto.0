Sadly I don't think this is going to work.

One purely technical and resolvable issue is that we don't run
autobuilder builds with warnings. Once you have one warning you stop
looking for other warnings and they breed and quality degrades. Any
proposal where the autobuilder runs with warnings will therefore not
work. That issue is solvable.

Another issue is timescale. A decent portion of our users don't run day
to day builds with master. We can agree they probably should, but
people don't do many things they really should. If we're lucky they
switch every six months but some switch every two years on the LTS (or
worse). There has so far been an understanding that we wouldn't "pull
the rug out" from under things they use. Given what you want to achieve
above, I suspect six months of warnings is too long, let alone two
years of them.

If you do run warnings with such a long time frame, it also devalues
them as people will start to just ignore them. Currently most users do
tend to fix warnings which isn't something I want to "undo".

So yes, there may well be a long list of things you want to remove from
core, however, we also have to think about the project's use and why
people use it. It is often because we're able to support many weird use
cases and interesting scenarios that people do adopt and use the
project. I don't want to have a clinical core that is so opinionated
about how it should be configured, people can't innovate or experiment
and go and use other tools and systems.

Even taking some things which should be "uncontroversial" like ppc or
mips support, there is a core of project members who do want and need
at least some level of support for those architectures. There is some
level of willingness to help too, it just doesn't work on the
timescales we often run into problems and need them fixed within (e.g.
upgrading to a new gcc whilst users of fedora 40 run into build
issues). There is a bit of a point of pride that our tools can and do
support the old and new like this. Where we have removed things like
uclibc in the past, we probably did lose some userbase to other
projects as a result and we did dent our reputation for being able to
support wide and varied use cases. With uclibc, I agree it could be
done in a separate layer if there was demand but it didn't happen as
nobody had the time/skills to make that transition.

I guess my other worry is even if you do get feedback saying "yes, we
use this", how do you evaluate that. Does it only count if you support
the project in some way? Do you have to have 5 people respond? 50? I
suspect with a number of the changes you're thinking of, you'd argue
they shouldn't be using XXX anyway. If that is the case, the process
probably isn't needed and we should be moving more directly to making a
decision and making a change, which is the direction I've been trying
with a number of other changes.

My final comment would be able removal vs simplification. I'm keen to
try and simplify where we can as I think it is a much bigger problem
than needing to remove things. The unpack changes do make devtool much
simpler and we have scope to simplify in other areas too. Layer

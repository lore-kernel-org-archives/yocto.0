So I ran cyclictest with an idle system and loaded with multiple 
instances of cat /dev/zero > /dev/null &

#cyclictest -a 0 -p 99 -m -n -l 100000 -q

I ran this command as shown by Toyoka at the 2014 Linuxcon Japan 
[http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/toyooka_LCJ2014_v10.pdf]
to compare against his results for the BBB.  I also threw in xenomai 
with kernel 3.8 for comparison.  For the standard kernel HR timers were 
disabled.

[idle]
preempt_rt: min 12 avg: 20 max: 59
standard: min: 8005 avg: 309985955 max: 619963985
xenomai: min: 8 avg: 16: max 803

[loaded]
preempt_rt: min 16 avg: 21 max: 47
standard: min: 15059 avg: 67769851 max: 135530885
xenomai: min: 10 avg: 15: max 839

Actually the preempt_rt results tie up pretty well with Toyooka above, 
leading me to conclude theres something off in my code that could be 
optimised - what do you guys think.
Also, I ran a test with preempt_rt at 100Hz and there was maybe 10% 
improvement in latency.

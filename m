I merged a set of patches just in the last couple of days that addresses
a SRC_URI issue and wildcards for bbappends that I hope resolves all of
the current crop of these.  If you update your tree now you will likely
see those go away.  If not, please let me know.

Alternatively, I'm not aware of any issues in 1.7 of that sort (though
now that I think about it, I need to check the SRC_URI one, I bet that's
there), so using the latest released Yocto with a like-named branch in
meta-selinux should always be safe.

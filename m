I'd like to question this. Is the goal for Poky/Yocto to track the 
bleeding-edge releases of software, or is the goal to be a well-tested 
and stable foundation for embedded software applications?

Upgrading a recipe within a couple of weeks of its release may end up 
using more of our resources if/when we encounter new bugs that were 
introduced in the new release. Or worse, if we don't encounter them 
during distro builds and then our users take our release and discover 
them for themselves.

I'm not saying we need to be as conservative as long-term-support 
enterprise Linux distros, but IMHO I think racing to always upgrade our 
recipes to versions released a handful of weeks ago can be 
counterproductive in many situations.

A policy I might put forward for consideration is this: recipe upgrades 
are done once per release cycle, and upstream versions that have come 
out within the last 30 days should not be upgraded unless we have a 
really good reason for doing so.

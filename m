In the past I've done this with an initrd, with a custom /sbin/init that mounted
and then did a reexec for the real init system or ordered things in such a way
that the overlay happened -very- early.

Yup.  I just want to make sure people know one tool isn't going to do
everything..  and the integration of a single tool shouldn't restrict people for
doing other things with custom tooling.

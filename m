Hi Richard,

Thank you for the explanations!

At least SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS says its AlmaLinux 9.1. I'm not familiar 
with this distribution, but since 9.1 and 9.2 look different (9.2 being 
supported, 9.1 not, see https://mirrors.almalinux.org/isos.html), I 
think we should make the difference.

Do you agree that the documentation should only advertise as supported 
the intersection of SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS and the ones that are still 
supported by  their maintainers? If we agree on this and it turns out we 
neither test AlmaLinux 8.8 nor 9.2, it means that we currently don't 
support AlmaLinux any more.

Oops, I don't understand how you deduce this from this file. Mickledore 
isn't event listed in it.
Cheers,
Michael.

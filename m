Right, this would be the next step. I think we'd have to be careful about how 
we present search results from other branches / OE-Classic (so it's clear what 
is being shown) but now we actually have the data it's certainly technically 
possible. I'll be continuing to work on this application as my spare time 
allows.

Cheers,

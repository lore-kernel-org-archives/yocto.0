Hi, all,

I just create a new wiki page to track LTP status for Yocto Project:

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/LTP_result

Embedded Linux distribution is unlike a typical desktop Linux, because it's=
 normally
customized for specific purpose and thus not all packages required by norma=
l Linux
test suites (LTP/POSIX/LSB) are included in a specific profile.

Given that, the major purpose of this wiki page is for tracking and referen=
ce. For
one we want to track the ongoing trend in each Yocto release/milestone, and=
 fix
regressions in time. In the meantime, we also want to understand what a fai=
lure
implicates. Is it simply come from the fact of customization, or from some =
problems
in installed packages? For the former we want to document them, and for the=
 latter
we'd like to fix them.

I tried to make the page simple, as there could be many combinations to sho=
w
the data (milestones, machines, error types, etc.). Now it's still experime=
ntal and
under development. So far I use qemux86 result from the 12/11 nightly resul=
t
as the example based on SDK profile. Later when our QA team finish the M2 t=
est,=20
we'll update this page to reflect latest milestone information.

Thanks
Kevin

Hello All,

Recently Richard sent around an email proposing that a new repository be 
created for hosting layers that are not part of the core Yocto Metadata.

This new repository "poky-extras" can host different contributed layers 
and will be open to any one.

 From Richard's proposed ground rules:

> * it has the OE style open contributions model
> * consists of a set of layers, each clearly identified at the top level
> * each layer has a clearly named maintainer or maintainers
> * people respect the layer maintainers
> * layers are split into logical "topics" where at all possible

The first layer contained in this new repository is the meta-linaro 
layer, the top level repository will be removed short since it will now 
be maintained in poky-extras.

If you require write access to this repository, please send your request 
to git-requests@yoctoproject.org

I have just pushed out the patch series to bump the scarthgap/rust mixin
to Rust 1.81.0, and I have the same mostly in hand for kirkstone/rust, but
there is an issue I wanted to get community feedback on before committing
to a course of action.

The issue stems from librsvg >= 2.59 now needing at least meson 1.2.0,
which is a lot newer than what is available in kirkstone.  That rules
out backporting the librsvg 2.59.2 upgrade from oe-core into the mixin,
and dropping support of some kind is not feasible as the librsvg 2.52.10
recipe in poky kirkstone does not build with the backported Rust toolchain
changes (note I mean the various bbclasses here, I've not gotten to the
point of trying to build it with Rust 1.81.0).  Another more general issue
here for kirkstone branch users is that librsvg upstream have recently
updated their supported release list to just 2.59.x due to the effort
required to backport fixes[1].

The upshot of the above is that is raises the question of how folks would
like me to proceed with librsvg in the mixin.  I see the following options
in order of likely increasing effort:

1. I stick with the librsvg 2.58.2 recipe and leave things alone unless
   it stops building on a future Rust upgrade.  This is effectively
   sweeping the issue under the rug for now.
2. I do upgrades to newer librsvg 2.58.x releases (currently 2.58.5)
   in the mixin to perhaps provide a bit better story wrt security fixes.
3. I drop the librsvg backports in the mixin in favor of attempting to
   instead carry a replacement recipe that builds the same librsvg 2.52.x
   (currently 2.52.10) that is in poky kirkstone with the newer Rust
   toolchain.  As mentioned above, at the moment I'm currently unsure if
   2.52.x will build with 1.81.0, so there is some more risk on that
   front.  The argument for this would be matching what stock kirkstone
   provides.

I would appreciate input from users of the mixin on which approach they
would like to see, especially options (2) vs (3).  I'm sort of ruling out
significant hackery to enable using new meson for building librsvg, but if
someone has already done similar without needing to carry a lot of
baggage, I could maybe be convinced to try that approach...

Thanks,

Scott

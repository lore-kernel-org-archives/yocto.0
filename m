Hi all,

To monitor/scan vulnerabilities (CVE), check affected packages, versions, b=
ranches, fixed versions/branches etc ... we need either to file a bug in bu=
gzilla for each publically disclosed CVE or have a simple data base. Today,=
 we sometimes file a bug but most of the time vulnerabilities just get fixe=
d by someone volunteer and some vulnerabilities don't get fixed.

We have created a CVE list just for test to see if this is easier to mainta=
in and provides better overview, please have a look at this and let us to k=
now what you think:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13o4IPsCQ42aR2CCGzYOHdmpIEHkHUwDWlF4=
QqgI6emQ/edit#gid=3D0=20

The alternative for maintaining such a list is filing a bug in Bugzilla. Th=
e question is which approach is the best, here are some pros and cons:

Bugzilla:=20
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
- it takes more time to create/update a bug  in Bugzilla (not a big problem=
)
- history, traceable who updated
- when we have releases, we go through open bugs and try to get them fixed

Question: can we generate a report from Bugzilla, search for CVEs and find =
out what CVEs have been fixed and in what branches etc?


CVE spread sheet:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+ Easy to update, anyone just can add info preferably automatically; we cou=
ld use a tool to check with NVD (https://nvd.nist.gov/ ) daily and update t=
he list (some human interactions needs to be done though)=20
+ easy to have an overview
- ?

Any comments?

Thanks
Sona

To start with I'll try and write down and give a random walk through my
thoughts.

Certainly we need to get something like that patchset over the line. I
think it was blocked on a reply to this email:

https://lists.openembedded.org/g/openembedded-core/message/186497

which has suffered whilst I was pulled into the qemuppc mess. I feel
bad for not getting to a reply to that.

There are design elements to this work. We need to work out how we can
make eSDK and "normal" builds more similar and less of an overhead to
switch between one and the other. A "bblock all" command does partly
get you to an eSDK effectively so part of this may be switching eSDK to
use the new lock command. What other differences are there? What other
differences are necessary or make sense for the use cases eSDK was
designed for? How would you turn an existing build into an eSDK like
one? Could you provide a copy of a local build to someone else easily
using something like eSDK's tooling? What does the eSDK look like at
the end of this. One section we don't have good answers to yet is setup
and configuration although I know you've started on some of that.

For the task signatures, we need to think about some questions. If I
make a change locally, can I query how much will rebuild and how much
will be reused? There is bitbake --dry-run but perhaps it is time for a
an option (or dedicated separate command?) to give some statistics
about what bitbake would do? How much sstate would be reused?

That then logically leads into the questions, can we tell what has
changed? Why isn't my sstate being reused? For that we perhaps should
define some existing scenarios where it is currently very difficult to
work this out and then work out how we can report that information to
the user. These could become test cases?

One of the big problems in the past was that we lost much of the hash
information after parsing completed. This meant that if the hashes then
didn't match, we couldn't tell why as the original computation was
lost. I did some work on allowing us to retain more of the information
so that we didn't have to recompute it every time to be able to do
processing with it. I have to admit I've totally lost track of where I
got to with that.

Michael Halstead will be working on setting the CDN up so I'll let him
comment on when we'll have things ready for testing with that. We do
already have sstate shared from the autobuilder so some basic tests to
make sure our "base" shared files do work as expected is something
which can happen there already.

Another interesting question - would the project be interested in
shipping "locked" hashes for a minimal subset of recipes such as rust-
native and maybe the cross compilers to bootstrap and speed people's
builds, assuming they have a fast network? What does the size of those
pieces look like and would it be useful/effective?

Probably more questions than answers here but it hopefully gives a bit
more insight into some of the directions I'm thinking about.

Cheers,

Richard

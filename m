  in the YP dev manual, section 3.1.6, there is a maddeningly vague
note:

"It is possible for a recipe with a lower version number PV in a layer
that has a higher priority to take precedence."

  so does it take precedence or not? just saying it's "possible"
doesn't clarify it for the reader.

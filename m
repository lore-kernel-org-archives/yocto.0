  currently psyching up to work my way through the kernel dev manual,
and i noticed this:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/kernel-dev/kernel-dev.html#scc-reference

that reference list seems incomplete. at a *brief* glance:

* no mention of the "force" directive
* no mention "include" directive has optional following keywords, such
  as "nocfg" or "inherit"
* no mention of kconf keyword "required", which i've seen on occasion

  again, that was a very brief observation, not meant to be a complete
list.

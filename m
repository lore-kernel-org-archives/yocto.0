Others have made some good comments. My thoughts:

* We need to add some runtime tests to oeqa for this (in addition to
the ptests)

* We need to have a 32 bit ptest run on the autobuilder (qemux86 should
work, not sure we can make qemuarm fast). Whether this is manually
triggered, not sure. We could have a smaller set of ptests to run for
it?

* Could we optionally disable some of the glibc 32 bit function calls
to ensure they're not being used? We don't really want to diverge from
upstream glibc much though.

* We need to work out how to communicate this change happened and have
people "buy in" to it. The reason for that is that if someone has
existing binaries, there could be problems using them after the change.
We therefore need to be sure they are aware of it.

Cheers,

Richard

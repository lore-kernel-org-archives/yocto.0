I agree it's a bit annoying that some projects have chosen to rename the
existing branches instead of just adopting "main" to be the default
branch only for new projects (as the defaults changed e.g. on github).

I've already added explicit branch=3Dmain in 10+ recipes in various layers
for dunfell and newer branches (ostree in meta-oe just today or e.g.
https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/pull/846 yesterday).

Luckily it's easy to fix with local bbappend, so even people using
unsupported release (zeus and older) can do so or finally upgrade to
some supported release which might have this fix already.

It was also discussed shortly in #yocto yeasterday:

22:38 < zeddii> RP: did we come up with a policy on anything we can do
with the fetcher to make "main" be a fallback default to master. Or was
the end decision to just add explicit branch statements everywhere ?
23:21 < RP> zeddii: I'm open to patch proposals or we just set the
branch on urls
23:23 < RP> zeddii: being explicit is perhaps the better option that
magic in the fetcher

And I agree with RP, especially because fetcher magic won't get
backported to old bitbake used in zeus and older anyway, so it won't
help there and backporting fetcher change locally will be more risky
than backporting simple SRC_URI change for individual recipes which need
it.

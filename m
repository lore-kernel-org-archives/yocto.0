logs
       if the "postpone_output 0" directive was used with SSI includes.

       backend response while caching.

       "scgi_force_ranges", and "uwsgi_force_ranges" directives.

    *) Feature: the "proxy_limit_rate", "fastcgi_limit_rate",
       "scgi_limit_rate", and "uwsgi_limit_rate" directives.

    *) Feature: the "Vary" parameter of the "proxy_ignore_headers",
       "fastcgi_ignore_headers", "scgi_ignore_headers", and
       "uwsgi_ignore_headers" directives.

    *) Bugfix: the last part of a response received from a backend with
       unbufferred proxy might not be sent to a client if "gzip" or =
"gunzip"
       directives were used.

    *) Bugfix: in the "proxy_cache_revalidate" directive.
       Thanks to Piotr Sikora.

    *) Bugfix: in error handling.

    *) Security: it was possible to reuse SSL sessions in unrelated =
contexts
       if a shared SSL session cache or the same TLS session ticket key =
was
       used for multiple "server" blocks (CVE-2014-3616).
       Thanks to Antoine Delignat-Lavaud.

    *) Bugfix: in the ngx_http_spdy_module when using with AIO.

    *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process if =
the
       "set" directive was used to change the "$http_...", =
"$sent_http_...",
       or "$upstream_http_..." variables.

1.9.1


Well, the Changelog changes depending what's published. Currently it's
http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES - but when a 1.10 or a 2.0 will be released,
it's going to be http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES-1.9 (but this file =
currently
doesn't exists :/)

Aaand - even if http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES-1.9 would exists, it will
include even the changes for a potential 1.9.6, 1.9.7 ... regardless
we have updated to those versions ...

I'd like also like to mention that my main concern with the ver_linux files
that I found in my project was that the shebang line was " #!/bin/sh"
instead of "#!/bin/awk -f" which is the shebang line in the ver_linux file
in the patch.  The patch wants to change the shebang line from "#!/bin/awk
-f" to  "#!/usr/bin/awk -f" so I'm not sure how that change would translate
when I'm working with the shebang line "#!/bin/sh".  Or perhaps Yocto has
changed since that patch was posted and maybe the place /bin/awk is
specified is different?

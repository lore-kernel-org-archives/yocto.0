All of these I would like to extract again, but I'm concerned we may not
be able to do this without some duplication of meta-python recipes.
Still, that's what I was hoping for.

There's certainly a few other groups / companies, but I'm certain
they're all using the 1.7 branch for now, not master, and manually
updating to the latest refpolicy release (which came out days after we
branched for 1.7) in their own tree.  I'm preparing an update to the
newest refpolicy now, but we're also not far away from the next one, so
I'm almost tempted to wait it out at this point and jump right to the
201503* refpolicy.  I'd be interested to hear opinions on that from
anyone using meta-selinux and wanting to use the master branch.

Can we update the OEDAM web page with some of these ideas:

http://openembedded.org/wiki/OEDAM

Discussion should continue on the list, but we have an agenda item to
talk about the next release and this would be a good time to review the
ideas raised in the this thread. I put in a placeholder with the link to
Otavio's email. (And I really like his thoughts)

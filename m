We are happy to announce that the Embedded & IoT micro-conference was
again accepted for Linux Plumbers this year. Hosted in beautiful Tokyo,
Japan December 11-13.
https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2005/

Topics cover all things embedded and IoT. Boot time to kernel size, low
power communication, telemetry and also RTOS. Devicetree and build
system have their own MC and we can move sessions between them as needed.

As with all MC's at Plumbers we are not looking for talks, but rather
discussing current problems and working towards their solution. If your
proposal has a specific stakeholder (maintainer, developer, company)
that would be needed for a fruitful discussion, please mention it in
your submission.

The CfP is open now and will run until October 3rd. Please do not wait
until the end with your submissions as we are going to accept good
proposals even before the end, so the MC might be filled up before 
October 3rd.

Jan & Stefan

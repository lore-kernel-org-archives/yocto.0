IMO that makes it unsuitable for the docs as we strive to have "simple" ex=
amples and having some custom unpack task seems a bit too much to me=2E Any=
way, just my 2=C2=A2 and I don't have any other prebuilt lib to suggest as =
replacement right now=2E

Back to the topic:
I think you could have an :append for do_unpack and probably call oe_unpac=
k ( https://github=2Ecom/openembedded/openembedded/blob/fabd8e6d07d3cd0cc93=
c2a0fc804f8c8f316c649/classes/base=2Ebbclass#L158) on this specific file (a=
fter it's been unzipped), or even call unpack_file from the OE libs directl=
y ( https://github=2Ecom/openembedded/openembedded/blob/fabd8e6d07d3cd0cc93=
c2a0fc804f8c8f316c649/lib/oe/unpack=2Epy#L50) like oe_unpack is doing=2E Be=
 aware though that since it is a Python task, your :append shall be Python =
code too=2E

Maybe there's another way but I don't see it right now=2E

Cheers,
Quentin

The migration is complete. Please update your address books to point to the
new list e-mail addresses. There are rewrites in place so the previous
mailing list addresses will continue to work for a limited time. I am
sending this message to the old addresses to test that functionality. In
the next few days we will have redirects for the old pipermail archives to
keep links working. We are also in the process of setting up
https://public-inbox.org/README.html for users who would like to retrieve
list mail using git. Lists and archives are currently accessible via the
links at https://www.yoctoproject.org/community/mailing-lists/.

If you are currently a member of any list your account is already created.
Visit https://lists.yoctoproject.org/sendloginlink and enter the e-mail you
receive list mail at to receive a login link and set a password.

If you have questions please visit
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/index.php?title=GroupsMigration to see
if they have been answered. E-mail pointofcontact@lists.yoctoproject.org
with new questions.

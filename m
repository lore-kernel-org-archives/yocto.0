Thanks for the report.

>

revision 25243, I assume there should be no differences?

there are no functional differences.

ore and eglibc. Since the eglibc project has closed its development (http:/=
/www.eglibc.org/archives/patches/msg01327.html), and that 2.19 is the final=
 version. Are there any plans to switch oe-core to using glibc for the futu=
re? Just curious is all.

Sure there definitely are and we discussed it in Last OE meeting on
IRC recently, we will plan moving to using glibc after 2.19, so these
will be last 2.19 eglibc recipes.

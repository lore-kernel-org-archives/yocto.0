In case anyone cares, the "per-recipe based staging" used in OE-lite,
and proposed as a future design concept for OE-core (although clearly
not going to be used in OE-core anytime soon) is also task based in the
above context, and has the same advantage as described for sstate above.

I just wanted to make the point as the "any recipe based approach" could
easily give casual readers the assumption that this was a weak point in
my proposal.

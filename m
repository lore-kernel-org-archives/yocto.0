What is your kenel config? Is KVM built-in (y) or built as module (m)?

I din't know which image you are building. Those variables are tricky, since
they only applies when basing on the packagegroup-core-boot packagegroup.
Please refer to the documentation.

Why trying to install the image into image? kvm-image-minimal is not a 
package, it is image recipe.
The build can definitely break in this case.

IMHO: Simply use IMAGE_INSTALL += "kernel-modules" (IMAGE_INSTALL += 
"kernel-module-kvm" will likely install just the KVM module)
in your local.conf to install all built kernel modules. If KVM module 
won't be present in the rootfs, it means it was not built.

Please inspect your kernel work dir (packages-split dir) to find out 
which packages were produced by
the kernel recipe. It will be something like 
build/tmp/work/XX/linux-yocto/XX/packages-split

Hi Jupiter,
I cannot help you on the specific chip you ask, but responding to the
second part of your question I have quite good experience with Microchip
WILC1000/3000 on SDIO which, after a part separate repo and then staging,
is now in mailine from quite some time:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000
I had also some mixed experience (seemed to be arch releated) otherwise
also with SDIO/SPI of SiLabs which is currently in mainline staging:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/staging/wfx
These chips are at least currently still on the market (modulo shortage
problems), not sure about their projected lifespan (I guess something hard
to foresee).

Cheers,
Federico

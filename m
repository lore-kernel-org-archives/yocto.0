From: Liping Ke <liping.ke@intel.com>

Extra RecipeInfo will be all defined in this file. Currently,
Only Hob (Image Creator) Requests some extra fields. So
HobRecipeInfo is defined. It's named HobRecipeInfo because it
is introduced by 'hob'. Users could also introduce other
RecipeInfo or simply use those already defined RecipeInfo.
In the following patch, this newly defined new extra RecipeInfo
will be dynamically loaded and used for loading/saving the extra
cache fields.

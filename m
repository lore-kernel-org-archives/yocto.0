Hi all,

As some of you are aware some of my colleagues and I have been working =
on=20
improving how incoming patches are handled - initially for OE-Core but =
we hope=20
to arrive at something that will be useful for other layers as well. Th=
e aim=20
was to do so without adversely affecting existing workflows, so that me=
ans=20
building on top of the things we already have. It's taken a bit longer =
than=20
we'd originally planned - we embarked on this a little over a year ago =
[1] -=20
but now I am happy to be able to show some meaningful progress.

A few months ago we upgraded OE's patchwork instance [2], moving not ju=
st to a=20
later version but to a fork of patchwork where a bunch of new functiona=
lity=20
was being developed for freedesktop.org [3], notably support for captur=
ing and=20
presenting patch series instead of just individual patches. There were =
some=20
teething problems but we've now resolved most of them. Unfortunately wo=
rk on=20
said freedesktop.org fork appears to have stalled so for now we have fo=
rked it=20
ourselves [4]; long term we'll have to see if we can merge back with pa=
tchwork=20
upstream - at least for small fixes we'll try to push those back up=20
independent of any wholesale merge. In any event we are now finally in =
the=20
position where our patchwork instance can be relied upon to collect ema=
ils,=20
and the UI is much improved. This should give us a bit more visibility =
into=20
where patches are at in the process, although we are still working on a=
 few=20
places where patch series status needs to be updated (e.g. when a patch=
 goes=20
into testing).

On top of patchwork we have built a simple smoke-testing framework call=
ed=20
"patchtest" [5] along with a suite of corresponding tests for OE [6]. T=
hese=20
tests are fairly simplistic at this point but check the basics such as =
whether=20
a patch has been properly signed off, etc. We should soon start seeing =
replies=20
sent to the mailing list and to submitters with results if there are an=
y=20
failures, saving us from noticing and pointing out some of the more obv=
ious=20
classes of mistakes. The tests are easy to run locally without the rest=
 of the=20
infrastructure and can be extended without difficulty, and I expect we'=
ll=20
continue to work on those as time progresses. Contributions would be ve=
ry=20
welcome.

My sincere thanks to Jos=E9 Lamego, Leonardo Sandoval, Daniela Plascenc=
ia,=20
Belen Barros Pena, Michael Halstead, Damien Lespiau, Patrick Ohly and o=
thers=20
that have been part of implementing this, and to everyone else who has =
put up=20
with the delays.

Please let us know if you have issues with any part of this process or=20=

suggestions on how to improve it. We're tracking improvements in the Yo=
cto=20
Project bugzilla [7] so you can see what's being worked on there if you=
're=20
interested.

Cheers,
Paul

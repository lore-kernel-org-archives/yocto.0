Hi Saul,
Here is the update for recipes in the list with me as the owner:

There are 18 recipes in total:=20
1) I have upgraded 14 ones:
renderproto
inputproto
libdmx
lttng-viewer
liburcu
libxxf86misc
compositeproto
resourceproto
xproto
gnome-doc-utils
scrnsaverproto
lttng-ust
librsvg
pixman: upgraded from 0.20.0 to 0.21.2 and later downgraded to 0.20.2 since=
 0.21.x is development release.

2) I decided to not upgrade these 2 ones and upgraded RECIPE_NO_UPDATE_REAS=
ON:
libunique: Do not upgrade to version: 2.91.4 because it requires gtk+ >=3D =
2.90.0 and the stable version of gtk+ used by poky is 2.2x.x
liberation-fonts:  Do not upgrade to version: 1.06.0.20100721 because befor=
e doing that, we need adding new native packages like libungif_4.1.3, libsp=
iro and fontforge first

3) These 2 ones doesn't need upgrade at present:
lttng-control: acutally not newer release is available. The script detectin=
g new release thought 0.88-09242010 are different from 0.88.  Mei Lei has f=
ixed that.
tcf-agent: as Lianhao said, the upstream is re-orging the code, so we can o=
nly wait for now. Previously the script detecting new release simply printe=
d a useless svn number "998".

Thanks,
-- Dexuan=

Thank you Nico for the five years in which we had the pleasure of working
together for the growth and future of the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded.
Your contributions and insight will be missed - but hopefully not you as a
person. We will meet again, over a drink, and talk of the olde times...

And on the same note, thank you Andy, Richard, and all of the leadership
working group for the trust placed in me. Let us make this a change that
keeps the good and adds more of it.

Greetz,
Josef

The idea is to integrate one, not build one from the scratch.

Yeah, it would be possible to have two "rootfs" and do the update and 
the just reboot one time.

I plan to release this in phases, in the first one it will be manually 
do the update. The idea is implement tools to automate the process of 
the update (where it can be automated).

If you are referring to the filesystem creation I would say very 
flexible. It will be implemented using wic instead of a class, so just 
needs to change a file to suit your needs. If you refer to the swupdate 
features, I plan to have a generic use case; as an example I won't use 
the MTD capabilities of the software.

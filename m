Part of the discussion should be identify issues with projects like LAVA
and see if the LAVA developers agree with our perceptions and work out
if there is a way we can work together to remove the issues. I certainly
see a lot of promise in LAVA, but the comments Paul has are big problems
for the OpenEmbedded Community.

Part of the point of the Yocto Project is to try and focus people's
efforts on improving the embedded process, either by identifying
promising projects and working together to improve them, or by
developing new technology as needed. But before developing something
new, we nee to make sure we are not creating fragmentation in the
embedded space.

I thought about it and since class/conf changes that need to go in into OE-core
first I kept it as it is (lazyness too). I think once the core support
is available in OE-core
we can spin the recipes into a layer of its own.

start with what we have. Once master opens up I would propose the needed
changes to OE-core and spin a layer

Perhaps, yes.

I'm meaning=C2=A0disabling the 32 bit glibc time functions.

Right, but the 32 bit time functions/symbols are still available for
older binaries. My point is that anything using those older functions
is likely in need of attention so for Yocto Project/OE usage,
identifying those would be helpful. If we were to disable them, that
would make such usage very obvious.

Not necessarily. If it were a binary library, compiled with 32 bit
time_t, new binaries using it would use a different sized field.

That is definitely not the only problem. Some of the problems are
unlikely but we do need to consider them.

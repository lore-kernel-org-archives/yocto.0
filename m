Why does merging /usr have anything to do with this?  I've read the case for
merging /usr and / and still don't understand why it "helps".  The key is that
if you have separate partitions for /usr and /, then you need to update both of
them in sequence.  Merging these two just seems like a lazy solution to people
not wanting to deal with early boot being self-contained.

Also having a separate / from /usr can help with '/' be your maintenance
partition in some cases.

When using overlayfs, I'd strongly recommend not doing it over the entire
rootfs.  This is generally a bad idea for the reasons stated above.

However, overlaying a part of the rootfs often makes sense.  /etc is a good
example.  This way applications that want their configurations in /etc can still
have it that way -- and there is always a (hopefully) reasonable default
configuration, should the configuration 'partition' get corrupted.  So worst
case the user can start over on configurations only.

For applications and user data, these can and should be stored outside of the
main rootfs.  The FHS/LSB recomment '/opt', but while it doesn't matter if it's
-actually- /opt, the concept itself is good.


So going back to image upgrade.  The key here is that you need a way to update
arbitrary images with arbitrary contents and a mechanisms that is smart enough
to generate the update (vs a full image flash) to conserve bandwidth.

I still contend it's up to the device to be able to configure the system on how
to get the update and where to apply the update.  The tooling (host and target)
should simply assist with this.

Delta updates need version information in order to know they're doing the right
sequence of updating.

Full updates don't, but should be sent in a format that limits "empty space",
effectively send them as sparse files.

On many devices you will need to flash as part of the download due to space
limitations.

And you need the ability to flash multiple partitions.

maintenance
/
/usr
data

etc..  whatever it takes to either upgrade or restore the device.

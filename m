Still formatting the results, but should reply with the usage I've
seen.  Below is a profile of 5 customers who are actively using OE in
products:

#1: 6yrs, Angstrom, git subm, OPKG, GTK, systemd, glibc, C++, Jenkins, no tools
#2: 2yrs, Angstrom, git subm, OPKG, HTML/JS, systemd, glibc, C++/JS,
no CI, no tools
#3: 2yrs, nodistro/custom, git subm, OPKG, no GUI, sysvinit, musl,
Lua/C, no CI, no tools
#4: 3yrs, Angstrom, git subm, OPKG, no GUI, systemd, glibc, C++/TCL,
no CI, no tools
#5: 5yrs, Angstrom & custom, git subm, OPKG, Qt, sysvinit, gllibc,
C++, no CI, no tools

All customers primarily develop apps on PC/test on target.  One is
using OE generated SDK's.

Most new projects I do will be moving from Angstrom to nodisto/custom distro.

musl has been working great on one project, so expect to use that more
in the future.

Thanks,
Cliff

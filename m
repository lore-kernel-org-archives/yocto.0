  (aside: currently going through yocto BSP developer's guide with my
proofreader's beanie on so be prepared for a few BSP-related questions
today. you've been warned.)

  in section on BSP requirements:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/bsp-guide/bsp-guide.html#released-bsp-requirements

there are alleged requirements like the existence of README and
README.sources files, but it seems lots of layers at
http://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/ don't have one or the other
of those files. could that explanation be refined a bit? or should
those layers suck it up and add all files that are allegedly
"required"?

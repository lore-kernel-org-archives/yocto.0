I have got core-image-minimal building for arm now. All changes are
pushed to contrib tree this includes util-linux fixes too.

The changes are not very intrusive, I think it is of value to include recipe
fixes in the layers they belong too and most of changes to packages are worthy
of upstreaming. The patches for compilers aren't final yet and they
will be rebased
as I add other architectures one after another. I am not convinced yet
if we would need a layer of its own.
A layer is premature at this point of
time. if you fix something thats not on there you can share by pushing
into another contrib tree and inform me
I can include the fixes into this tree.

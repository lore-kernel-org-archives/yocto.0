The key lesson is our current "migration" code in OE-Core sucks and I
have some patches in progress which rewrite pieces of it in a way that
makes it more useful. I'm therefore trying to make some positives from
it.

That said, I haven't found a way to make this work without leaving a
dummy layer.conf in the old location since a missing layer.conf file is
fatal to bitbake very early on before any migration code triggers.

More should become clear when I post the patches, I've been holding off
that until I actually manage a patch set that works on the
autobuilder...

Patches should be out over the weekend (in time for the freeze).

Cheers,

Richard

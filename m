This list is specifically for Yocto-related projects which don’t have their own mailing list or other patch submission process.   We ask that all layers currently using yocto@ for patches move to yocto-patches@, so that yocto@ can be used purely for discussion and other non-patch related subjects.

I've just asked them to index the new lists as well as these important 
ones which are missing too:
https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto-announce
http://lists.openembedded.org/mailman/listinfo/openembedded-architecture
https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/automated-testing
https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto-security

Cheers
Michael.

Whilst this is a key area I'd like to see worked on in 1.7 and I do have
ideas related to it, they're in various states of development. Some have
bugzilla entries and good information, others are much less well
formulated and don't have bugzilla entries yet.

So no wiki page exists and the "standalone app developer might build an
image" item isn't well defined as yet. There have been some developments
which lead into it like wic and the locked sstate work though.

Here on the mailing list is probably as good a place as any for the
discussion, which can then be turned into something in the bugzilla.

Cheers,

Richard

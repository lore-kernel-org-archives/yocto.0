Richard/Saul,

This fixes BUGID #596 (mouse in qemuarm), through the fixing of
the linux-libc-headers-yocto recipe. The mouse was broken due to
tslib being out of sync with the kernel and not activating the
pointer. Having the matching kernel headers fixes this problem.

** Note: I saw some instances where I was getting fetcher/unpack
errors during my testing of this. I wasn't able to consistently
reproduce the error, so I wasn't able to conclusively determine if
it has anything to do with the libc-headers change. I recommend
that we watch this carefully and be prepared to revert as required
(revert the headers preference in qemu.inc).

This also updating the SRCREVs of the target branches in the linux-yocto
development kernel to point to 2.6.37-rc6 content.

And finally, this updates the meta branch to remove the rest of the _'s
from branch meta data. At this point branches have been switched
from _ to - and we are able to remove the old branch names. (which
I have done).

Pull URL: git://git.pokylinux.org/poky-contrib.git
  Branch: zedd/kernel
  Browse: http://git.pokylinux.org/cgit.cgi/poky-contrib/log/?h=zedd/kernel

Thanks,
    Bruce Ashfield <bruce.ashfield@windriver.com>

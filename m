These are the test cases I can find in Testopia:

https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/tr_list_cases.cgi?searchstr=3Dhob&current=
_t
ab=3Dcase&summary_type=3Danywordssubstr&summary=3Dhob&field-1-0-0=3Dsummary=
&type-1-
0-0=3Danywordssubstr&value-1-0-0=3Dhob

Hopefully someone from QA can provide more details on how to run them.

If you want any input on how to present the new options in the UI, let me
know. I'll be happy to help.

Cheers

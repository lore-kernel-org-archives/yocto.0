Richard/Saul,

I've been running with these changes since before ELC, so they've had
some good soak time. The first two changes lay the ground for for some
1.1 functionality and are used by recipes in the meta-kernel-dev layer.
The changes are transparent to existing recipes.

In particular they are related to auto creating meta data for kernel
repository builds. They are enough for basic korg/defconfig builds and
limited other repository building. More changes will complete this work
shortly.

The last patch just updates the SRCREVs to pickup Khem's backported
perf tool / gcc 4.6.0 patch.

There are about 8 more pending patches that deal with some recipe
renames, cleanup and more 1.1 functionality but I wanted to get
this first set of 3 out before rebasing the rest.

Sorry about the big cross post, but these changes span quite a few
different interest groups.

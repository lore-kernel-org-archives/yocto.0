Do you know a way to mount the overlay before all the services start? I 
tried to do this, but the only reliable way to do it was using a custom 
init, I couldn't accomplish this using systemd or sysvnit.

I was concerned about this too, not just bandwidth but resources in the 
target. Unfortunately I couldn't find an option that is generic enough 
to just provide the update. The idea is to integrate the tool into YP, 
not to develop a new one. Some of the tools that I checked needed to use 
btrfs partitions, need python in the target, or other constrains that 
make the update system impossible for a lot of targets.

The tool mentioned has this capability.

Yes, that would be possible, the only limitation is that is not possible 
to flash the partition that is being used.

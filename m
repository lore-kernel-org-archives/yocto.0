Known Issues
============

The Yocto project uses the bugzilla at http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org to handle bug tracking. You should always
consult that source first when experiencing any issue with a Yocto Project release.

      - Bug 414 - [PPC] kernel panic when booting poky-image-sdk-qemuppc through UNFS. The issues are intermittent and do
not show up for many people.
      - Bug 970 - yocto 1.0 sato-sdk 336 errors from zypper verify.
      - Bug 1029 - The Beagleboard can not boot up with 20110506 build. This bug has been partially fixed - the
instructions for the BeagleBoard have been updated, please see README.hardware for details.
      - Drivers - qemu GL passthrough can have issues if a closed source nvidia driver is used on the host system. Some
S3 suspend state issues exist with Intel BSPs, which are documented in bugzilla.
      - Docs - The Release documents included in the Yocto Project tarball might differ from the same documents accessed
from the Yocto Project website. Differences exist due to freeze dates prior to the release date. For the most up-to-date
Yocto Project documentation, always refer to the Yocto Project website at http://www.yoctoproject.org.


Thanks to everyone who helped with reporting and fixing bugs!

Fellow Developers,

Here I would like to remind us all that bug squash weekend is coming. In =
addition to the bugs mentioned in bugzilla, if you are interested to fix
bugs in other layers besides OE-Core then there are some world build =
failures recorded on OE wiki

http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Bitbake_World_Status

The links to failures logs are towards the end in above document.

Thanks
-Khem

I can confirm : You create a .github repo in your github organisation and
the templates inside will be used for every repos of the organisation.

For example: What you see when you try to create a PR :
https://github.com/yoconyptestgh/poky/pull/new/prononciation

What you can do with this: Have a default template "This project prefers
contribution via email, see contributing guide" for the whole org but repo
that want to follow github workflows (PR, issues) can override this in
their repo in a ".github/" folder. Not entirely satisfactory but better,
maybe?
NB: the vscode-bitbake repo already has it:
https://github.com/yoctoproject/vscode-bitbake/tree/staging/.github

Using "github actions" (the CI that could run on PR creation) seems
impossible without polluting our repos with a ".github/" repository.
If we accept to have a ".github/" directory, creating an action that
comments on every new PR is nearly trivial.

A single open pull request might also help github contributor understand
what the project want them to do:
https://github.com/yoconyptestgh/poky/pulls

Right now, the most clean approach I can think of is (given our
constraints):
* Selected repos in the yoctoproject github org use webhooks (available in
Free tier) to notify the creation of a PR or an issue
* We host (and maintain (!)) a service somewhere (on AB infra?) to receive
these notifications
* This service uses the github API to post a nice comment on the created
PR/issue (and can even close it).

I did not find a magic silver bullet that would solve everything (I
discovered that Gitlab is way more flexible on this subject).
I guess we need to find a compromise between what a github user sees and
the effort we are willing to put into it.

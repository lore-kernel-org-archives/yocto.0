I don't believe this is about a certain amount of cash in any way and I
think it's unfair to say it would be,
and I also believe that this has been called out by Tim and others several
times with little to no response
on someone offering to help out and those discussions need to be accounted
for, it isn't just about this last
message.

You've had enough time to port code to python3, and there has been an extra
effort to maintain this layer for
longer than it should have already.

If you have a product based on python2, or you use it in some way, at this
point, you need to allocate time to
work on it and maintain it (to be honest you should have started to
help out since several years ago),
simple as that, there's nothing else to read between the lines.

Again, as Alex said, "you" isn't targeted to anyone in specific, its simply
referring to anyone using it
(and probably complaining about support for it)

Alejandro

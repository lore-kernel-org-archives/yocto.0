It looks like some of my last pull request didn't make it
to master, so I've repeated it here. Patches 4/5 have already
been sent:

  kernel-yocto: pass the build directory to configme
  routerstation: disable command line overrides

The remaining three changes are new and are:

 - A merge from Darren to update the default 2.6.37 configs
   to enable the debug/ftrace configs we need.

 - A change to make board descriptions generic. These are
   transparent to nearly everyone, but any new BSPs will be
   described with: KARCH, KMACHINE and KTYPE which are more
   generic variables and used internally during kernel
   configuration. They are differnet from yocto/poky variables
   on purpose, since the kernel tree can be cloned and used 
   distinctly from any build system.

 - And finally an update to 2.6.37 with a port of the alternate
   RPC ports patch which reinstates usermode NFS support to
   2.6.37.

Also out of interest, the routerstation pro and fsl-mpc8315e-rdb
have all been booted against 2.6.37 and will follow shortly. 
Next up are feature merges (lttng, etc) to match the -stable 
kernel functionality.

Cheers,

Bruce

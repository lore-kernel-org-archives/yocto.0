Thanks it will be really helpful. Basically I'm doing same as
described here:
https://github.com/linux-sunxi/meta-sunxi/issues/240#issuecomment-496410993
Looking at sunxi-mali more devices should be supported:
COMPATIBLE_MACHINE =3D "(sun4i|sun5i|sun7i|sun8i)"

 And after all, although it doesn't seem right, at the same time this is th=
e beauty of the open source. I think the layers are just incompatible in th=
e way that they are do things. Also it's not bad to have alternatives.

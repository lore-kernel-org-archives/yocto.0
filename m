Hi Saul,

Here is an update for recipes in the list under my name.

I upgraded most of the recipes except:

1) upstream check error, actually they are up to date.
Speex, net-tools, libid3tag, libgsmd

2) git development tree:
Mtd-utils

3) dependency on other recipes:
Clutter-gst (depend on latest version of clutter).

Thanks,
Dongxiao

I sent out patches to fix these 4 issues to the list a week or so back.
Reviewing these things and getting them merged takes time though. AFAIK
the meta-selinux master branch hasn't built for months now mostly
because of bbappends trailing behind versions in oe-core. I've been
playing whack-a-mole on this but by the time patches get merged a new
version has changed elsewhere. I've been using wild-cards as much as
possible on account of this.

If SELinux support were to be integrated into oe-core directly this
would force similar support into other layers too no? The reach of
meta-selinux has expanded and the layers that must be pulled in to get
it to build has expanded from just oe-core to meta-virtualization (for
LXC) as well as a few layers in meta-oe.

I don't know much about the process here but these cross layer
dependencies would complicate things. I guess this would mean
integrating SELinux support as a distro feature (or whatever is
appropriate) into all of these layers directly. Not impossible but
getting buy-in from the relevant maintainers is necessary.

I guess I've been wondering the same thing. For OpenXT we had
implemented our own SELinux support on top of OE (we weren't OSS at the
time). Now that we are OSS we've re-based on meta-selinux but I don't
know of anyone else using this layer or at least discussing it publicly.

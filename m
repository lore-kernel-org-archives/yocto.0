Hello,

I need some help figuring out a build problem I'm seeing.  I know why the b=
uild is failing, I just don't know the best way to fix it.  I have figured =
out a workaround, but it seems very hack-ish to me, and I'd really like to =
know if there is a more elegant solution?  Is this a defect or something I'=
m doing wrong?  Has anyone else seen this?

- Setup:=20
Poky version is 1.7.1.  Working directories have been removed, forcing all =
packages to be restored through the setscene process. The rootfs is read-on=
ly, so postinst causes build failure instead of being postponed to first bo=
ot.

- Problem:
In this scenario I am consistently seeing 3 Poky recipes fail at postinst. =
 I have triaged the problem to be missing native-class dependencies for eac=
h of the 3 packages. =20

The problem packages are: ca-certificates, nss, and gdk-pixbuf-native.  ca-=
certificates and nss both depend on their own native-class builds, so ca-ce=
rtificates-native and nss-native respectively, and they fail after doing do=
_package_write_ipk_setscene.  gdk-pixbuf-native needs jpeg-native in order =
to complete do_populate_sysroot_setscene, but fails due to its absence.

Each of these recipes has a DEPENDS or PACKAGECONFIG appropriate to pull in=
 the needed package during the normal build process, but these dependencies=
 don't seem to carry over to the setscene process.

- My attempt at a solution:
My workaround is to write a bbappend for each of the 3 recipes that looks s=
omething like below, that explicitly add the missing dependencies:

--- /dev/null
+++ b/nss/nss_%.bbappend
+do_package_write_ipk_setscene[depends] +=3D "nss-native:do_populate_sysroo=
t"

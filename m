Python can reload modules but you'd have to deactive anything using them
to be able to reload so you'd have to reset all the state. I therefore
suspect this aspect would be hard.

I'd not rule them out, particularly if how to use them was well
documented. We'd need something well thought out though for it to be
merged. It really depends on the kinds of changes needed and how
invasive they were.

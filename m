Great news. I really want to look into this but as ever time is the
constraining factor.

Deltas. Yes I've seen binary deltas attempted over the years, with
varying degrees of success.

I can see how what you say could work at a file-system level if we could
separate out the
writeable data, yes. Not sure I've seen any tooling around this though?

Back in the day when I first started out with Arcom Embedded Linux in
the late '90's I had us
do something similar with a read only JFFS2 system partition and then a
separate app/data
partition. That seemed to work OK. Maybe I need to revisit that.

I'll take a look. Thanks.

Mmm. Yes I can understand that. Same here.

Interesting thanks. I don't recall seeing this in recipes. I might have
missed it or are not many
people using this features in their recipes? Of course the next issue is
not knowing what you
want to do with those conf files during an unattended upgrade onto an
embedded box.

Indeed.

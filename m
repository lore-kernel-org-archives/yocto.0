I think the both. :-)

This is always being a tradeoff in all distributions. There's no simple gui=
deline
whether there's severe risk to upgrade to a latest release, and I think the
one general rule is to pick up a newer release with enough stability. How t=
o
judge that? This finally goes to the owner of each recipe.

I think there's no simple guideline meaningful in general context like this=
. All the
decisions should come to the actual recipe maintainer, based on his knowled=
ge
in this specific area. Once we involve with upstream more closely, we shoul=
d be
able to tell whether a new release is worthy to go or not in most cases.

Besides that, what in general we can do is about the process.

That's why we come up a two phase upgrade windows in 1.0. With the first wi=
ndow
as the major upgrade, and the 2nd window to catch up minor version changes =
which
should be with little risk. If there's important release coming out in 2nd =
window, we
(again mainly the recipe owner) again need to make decision instead of a si=
mple
global rule "to go" or "not to go". As I raised in early thread, I suggest =
to those=20
minor version upgrade in later of 2nd window.

That's also why we're currently developing the package reporting system, wh=
ich is
expected to check upstream release periodically and once a new release comi=
ng
out the maintainer gets notified to make decision.

So in a nutshell:
	- the general goal is to being cutting-edge
	- we work out a process which give recipe maintainers enough opportunities
to check new releases of packages they own, toward our 'cutting-edge' goal
	- Saul generates a general candidate list from those info in start of each=
=20
upgrade window
	- then it's always recipe maintainers to make decision whether a new relea=
se=20
should go or not, based on its stability, new features and risks given time=
 to Yocto
release point. If there's a decision not to upgrade, the maintainer should =
document
it well

Having said that so far our process is not exactly as expected yet, and our=
 expertise
on each area still need time. But I think that's the what we'll need to be.=
 :-)

Thanks
Kevin
